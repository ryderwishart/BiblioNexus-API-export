They wanted to stay there instead of spreading out over the earth. This went against what God wanted for people. God stopped them by changing the language they spoke. This confused them because they could no longer understand one another. In the Hebrew language, the word Babel sounds like the word for confusion. Babel was a sign for people working together against what God wants."
