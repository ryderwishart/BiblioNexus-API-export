He set human beings apart as rulers over plants, animals, the land and the seas. This is one way that God created human beings to be like himself. As rulers, humans are to fill the earth and to bring it under control. This doesn’t mean that humans can use God’s earth however they want to. It means that they are to take care of everything on earth. They are to help everything be the way God wants it to be. Humans do this by following God’s example of ruling. God showed himself to be a ruler who blesses, honours and protects what he has made. Jesus showed that God is a ruler who gives everything to serve and to bless others. When human beings don’t follow God’s example of ruling, the earth suffers."
