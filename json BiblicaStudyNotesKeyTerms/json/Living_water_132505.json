Water is living when it’s fresh and moving. People drink it to stay alive and plants and animals can live in it. Prophets described God as a spring of water that gave life to his people. They described him as a shepherd who led his people to springs of water. And they described how water would flow out of Jerusalem. This water would give life to the whole world. In the New Testament, Jesus described the Holy Spirit as living water. Jesus gives living water to people who believe in him. This means that he shares the Holy Spirit with them. The Spirit provides what their spirits need. This is like how water provides what their bodies need. The Spirit helps them serve others. This is how the living water flows out from inside of people. In Revelation, God offers the water of life freely to everyone who believes in him."
