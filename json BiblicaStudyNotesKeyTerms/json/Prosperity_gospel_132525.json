It teaches that God gives riches to all who believe in Jesus and have faith in him. It teaches that they will always have more than they need. It also teaches that they will always have healthy bodies. It teaches that they will have all of these things while they are alive on earth. The good news about Jesus that is true doesnâ€™t teach these things. What is true is that Jesus saves people from the power of sin, death and evil. This salvation begins while people are alive on earth. It will be complete when Jesus returns and rules as King in the new creation. Jesus is the example for his followers about how to live. His example teaches believers how to serve others and how to face suffering."
