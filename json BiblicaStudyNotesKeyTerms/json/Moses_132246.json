His wife was Zipporah and their sons were Gershom and Eliezer. In the Hebrew language Moses means taken out. Pharaoh’s daughter took him out of the River Nile and raised him. God appeared to Moses in the desert. God told him to lead the Israelites out of slavery. Moses led them out of Egypt, through the desert and to their new land. Moses didn’t enter Canaan with them. God gave instructions to Moses about how the Israelites should live. These instructions are called the Law of Moses ("
