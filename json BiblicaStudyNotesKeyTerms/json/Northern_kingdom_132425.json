Important cities in the northern kingdom were Dan, Bethel and Samaria. Samaria became the capital city. The northern kingdom began when Jeroboam led many Israelites to refuse to follow Rehoboam. It ended in 722 BC when Assyria took control of Samaria. The people of the northern kingdom never returned from being exiled. Prophets to the northern kingdom included Ahijah, Jehu, Micaiah, Elijah, Elisha, Amos, Jonah, Hosea and Micah. The kings were Jeroboam, Nabad, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Omri, Ahab, Ahaziah, Joram, Jehu, Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam the second, Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, Pekah and Hoshea. None of those kings was faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant."
