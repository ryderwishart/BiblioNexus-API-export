These are things that God has shown about himself and ways that he has acted. In the New Testament, these things include the message of the good news about Jesus. The second meaning of faith is the belief itself. This is the trust that people have in God. It’s based on their hope of how God will keep his promises. How strong people’s faith is shows how much they trust God. Their faith grows as they know God more and more. The third meaning of faith is how people live based on what they believe. God’s people are to follow God’s ways for living. Jesus showed people how to do this. Faith in Jesus includes following his example for living."
