It includes the Ten Commandments. God gave these instructions through Moses. Some of the laws were about worshipping God in proper ways. Other laws were about how the Israelites were to treat one another. Others dealt with how the Israelites were to live together in communities and as a nation. The second meaning of the Law of Moses is the first five books of the Old Testament. That is where all the laws are recorded. These books are also called the Torah and the Pentateuch. In the Hebrew language Torah means law. In the Greek language Pentateuch means five scrolls. ("
