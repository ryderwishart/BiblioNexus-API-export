People, priests and prophets could be set apart to serve God in special ways. Things like animals, land and objects could also be set apart for the Lord. This meant that they weren’t used in the normal way. They were to be used only in special ways to serve God. The second meaning was when people or things were set apart to be destroyed. This was a way that God brought judgement against people’s evil deeds."
