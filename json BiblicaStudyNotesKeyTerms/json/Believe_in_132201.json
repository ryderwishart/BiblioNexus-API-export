It meant trusting that he would do what he promised to do. It led to obeying God and worshipping only him. Believing in God is how people were made right with God. In the New Testament, God showed that he also wanted people to believe in Jesus. This meant trusting that Jesus is who he says he is. It meant trusting that Jesus would do what he promised to do. Everyone who believes in Jesus is saved from the power of sin, death and evil. Jesus gives them life that never ends. People who believe in him obey him and follow his way of life. ("
