Placing hands on people became a common practice for specific reasons. These included praying for new believers to receive the Holy Spirit. They included praying for believers to receive a gift of the Holy Spirit. They included healing people and setting them apart to serve as leaders. Placing hands on someone was a way to show Godâ€™s love and care for them. Nothing magic happened by placing hands on someone. The blessings that came were from the Holy Spirit working through believers."
