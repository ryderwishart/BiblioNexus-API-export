It could be a time of being close to God or meeting with God. It could be a time of turning away from sin and having stronger faith in God. It may or may not have lasted for a period of 40 days and 40 nights. The numbers were a sign about the spiritual thing that happened. This sign was important in the lives of many prophets and in the life of Jesus."
