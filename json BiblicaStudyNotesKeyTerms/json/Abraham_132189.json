In the Hebrew language, one of the meanings for Abram’s name is father of many nations. Abraham became the father of the nation of Israel. He was married to Sarah and their son was Isaac. He had a son named Ishmael with Sarah’s slave Hagar. Abraham was from Shem’s family line and followed God faithfully. God made a covenant with Abraham and his family line. ("
