The one with less power would receive a reward for obeying the treaty or covenant. The reward was the covenant blessings. If they didnâ€™t obey the treaty or covenant, the covenant curses would happen. The people or groups making a covenant would share a meal or make a sacrifice. They would write down their agreement before witnesses. They would each keep a copy. That was how covenants were put into effect. In the Bible, covenants were usually between God and his people."
