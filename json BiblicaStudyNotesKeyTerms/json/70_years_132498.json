It was also a sign that the exile wouldnâ€™t last for ever. 70 years can describe several important periods of time. In the year 605 BC Nebuchadnezzar became king of Babylon. About 70 years later, the Persian government took control of the Babylonian government. In the year 605 BC people from Jerusalem were forced to live in Babylon.
