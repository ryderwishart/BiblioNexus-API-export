One meaning is God’s Spirit or the Holy Spirit. Another meaning is spiritual beings. Another meaning is the spirit of a person. When God created human beings he breathed life into them. This life from God is each person’s spirit. It’s the part of each person that exists as more than a body. It will exist for ever. Things that happen in a person’s spirit or to their spirit are described as spiritual. A person’s spirit is often understood to be like their heart or their soul."
