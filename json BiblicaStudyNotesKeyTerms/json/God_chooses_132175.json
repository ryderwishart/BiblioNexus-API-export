Choosing to make a covenant with Abraham and his family line is one example. The stories don’t fully explain why God made those choices. They do make it clear that God is good and can be trusted. He makes choices based on his knowledge and his love. Human beings don’t understand all of God’s choices. But they can trust that God is loving, wise and good."
