God’s covenant with Noah and the Ten Commandments made this clear. Murder was described as spilling someone’s blood on the ground. That blood made the ground impure. It cried out to God. This meant that the blood was a witness against the murderer. It showed that justice needed to be done. The murderer had to be put to death. That brought justice back to the people and to the land. In the New Testament, Jesus taught that murder meant more than killing someone. Hating someone was as serious a sin as committing murder."
