Slaves could do nearly every job in a household. Writers of the Bible didn’t teach people to have slaves. Old Testament writers taught how slaves and masters were to treat one another. This was based on the Law of Moses. All slaves among the people of Israel were allowed to rest on the Sabbath day. They were allowed to worship God along with free people. They weren’t required to stay slaves until they died. God’s people weren’t to be sold as slaves. New Testament writers taught that slaves and masters were equal members of God’s family. They were to serve Jesus and to serve one another. There is also a spiritual meaning for slavery in the Bible. Writers of the Bible described human beings as being slaves to sin. This means that sin rules over all human beings and controls them. Jesus frees people from being slaves to sin."
