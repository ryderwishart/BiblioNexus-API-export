This name showed that God had chosen Solomon to be king after David. Solomon was the king when the temple was built in Jerusalem. He was very wise and very rich. He wrote many proverbs and songs. Later in his rule Solomon stopped being faithful to God. This led to the nation of Israel separating into two kingdoms."
