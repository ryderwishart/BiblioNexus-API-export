This is how human beings obeyed Godâ€™s instruction to have children and fill the earth. The Law of Moses included many rules about marriage among the Israelites. The main rule was that husbands and wives were to always be faithful to one another. They were to have sex only with one another. Song of Songs gave an example of joy, respect and kindness in marriage. Old Testament prophets used marriage as a picture. It described something about the relationship between the people of Israel and God. God was like the husband and Israel was like the wife. God loved Israel and was always faithful to his people. New Testament writers also used marriage as a picture. Jesus was like the groom and the church was like the bride. This shows how much Jesus loves his followers."
