He taught Joash to be faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. Jehoiada led the people of Jerusalem to stop following Athaliah and to have her killed. Then he led them to make Joash king and to follow God’s covenant. When Jehoiada died the people honoured him by burying him with the kings of Judah. Later Joash put Jehoiada’s son Zechariah to death."
