They travelled from one place to another to find grass for their flocks. It’s also a way to talk about leaders who take care of other people. Israel’s leaders were often described as being bad shepherds. God was the good shepherd for his people. In the New Testament, church leaders are to be shepherds of Jesus’ followers. Jesus himself is the good shepherd of God’s people."
