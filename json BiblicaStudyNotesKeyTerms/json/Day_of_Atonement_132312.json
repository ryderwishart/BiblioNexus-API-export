Itâ€™s also called Yom Kippur by Jews who still celebrate it. The high priest sacrificed a bull for his sins and the sins of his family. He burnt incense and sacrificed one goat for the sins of all the Israelites. He sprinkled the holy tent and the Most Holy Room with the blood. This included sprinkling the altar and the cover of the ark of the covenant. Then the holy tent, the Most Holy Room and the altar were considered clean and pure. A live goat carried the sins of the people into the desert. Because of this, God remained present with the Israelites. ("
