As Jesus, he is a Jew who lived in Israel when the Roman government was in control. Jesus is also God’s Son. As Christ, he is the Jewish Messiah and King. The title Lord Jesus Christ means that Jesus is the King of everything. It means he is the Saviour who rescues God’s people and the natural world. He rescues them from sin, death, and evil. It means he is worthy of worship because he is God."
