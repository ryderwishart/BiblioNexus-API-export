Athaliah murdered the males in David’s family line who could have become king. She did this after Jehu killed her son Ahaziah. Only Joash was saved. Athaliah ruled as queen over the southern kingdom for six years. She led the people to worship Baal. She did many evil things. She was killed by palace guards."
