He would take action to make sure that all people honoured him. Other writers in the Bible described it as a time of suffering. It would be a time before God judged the world. People would do many evil things during that time. Some New Testament writers described the time after Jesusâ€™ resurrection as the last days. It was considered the time the church lives in until Jesus returns to earth."
