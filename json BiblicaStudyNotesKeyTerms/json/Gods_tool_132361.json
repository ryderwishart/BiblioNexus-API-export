Through them he brings judgement against people, groups or nations that do evil things. This is part of how he stops evil and brings back peace. God decides when to bring judgement and how to do it. Those that God uses as a tool aren’t better than those being judged. Every person, group and nation is responsible for serving and obeying God. They will all be judged for the evil things they do."
