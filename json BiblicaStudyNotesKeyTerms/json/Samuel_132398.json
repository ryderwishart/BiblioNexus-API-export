The name can also mean borrowed from God. Samuel was faithful to God his entire life. He was the son of Elkanah and Hannah. He was from the tribe of Levi through the family line of Korah. His sons were Joel and Abijah. Samuel was raised as a Nazirite in the holy tent at Shiloh. He started serving the Israelites as a prophet when he was young. He served as a priest after Eli died. When he served as judge God freed the Israelites from the Philistines. Samuel anointed first Saul and then David as king."
