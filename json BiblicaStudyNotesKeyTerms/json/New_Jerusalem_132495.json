In Jerusalem in Israel, God made his presence known in the temple. In the new Jerusalem of the future, God will be fully present everywhere. He will live with human beings for ever. There will be no suffering or death or sin there. Life will be the way God always wanted it to be for his creation. The new Jerusalem is called the bride of the Lamb. This is because all of God’s people live there. It’s also called the city of God and the heavenly Jerusalem. In the new Jerusalem God will rule as King. He will share his authority with his faithful followers."
