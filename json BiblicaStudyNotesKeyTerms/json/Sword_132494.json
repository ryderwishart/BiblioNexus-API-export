Writers in the Bible also said God’s word is like a sword. This showed that God’s word uncovers what is inside people’s hearts. It also showed that God’s word strengthens and protects believers when they struggle against evil. In a special way, the words from Jesus’ mouth were described as a sword. This was a picture of how Jesus is God’s word. Everything he speaks is the truth about God. Speaking truth about God is how he destroys the devil’s lies about God."
