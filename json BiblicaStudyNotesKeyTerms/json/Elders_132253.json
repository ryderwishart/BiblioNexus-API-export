They were also called the elders of the people or elders of the community. They passed down Jewish teachings, stories and laws through the years. They were to keep order and help the Israelites obey God’s laws. In the New Testament, a certain group of elders was called the Sanhedrin or Jewish Council. Most of them opposed Jesus and his teaching."
