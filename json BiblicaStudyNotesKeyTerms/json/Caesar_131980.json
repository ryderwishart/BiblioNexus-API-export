The rulers who came after him also used it. The Caesars after Julius were emperors of Rome. Almost all Caesars treated the people they ruled over very badly. Caesar Augustus was the emperor when Jesus was born. The Romans worshipped the emperor as lord and as the son of the gods. Those who refused to worship the emperor were treated badly. They weren’t allowed to buy and sell in the marketplace. The announcement that Jesus is Lord and God’s Son challenged the authority of Rome’s ruler."
