\p \k 12 Apostles\k*\im God had chosen the 12 Jewish tribes to do special work in the world. (See \k  tribes\k*\ef -  \fr  6:12-16 \fk  12 tribes of Israel: \ft  Jacob had 12 sons. The tribes were named after Jacobʼs sons and grandsons. These 12 family groups made up the nation of Israel. The families of Jacobʼs sons became very large tribes. God promised to give them the land of Canaan to live in. After many years, they were forced to leave that land. After that, it was no longer clear who or where all the 12 tribes were. In different parts of the Bible, the list of tribes includes different names. But they are all sons or grandsons of Jacob. Jews still talked about Godʼs people as the 12 tribes.\ef* \xt  Luke 6:1-11\xt*.) They were the start of Godʼs people in the nation of Israel. In a similar way, Jesus had chosen 12 Jewish apostles to do special work. They were the start of Godʼs people who trusted Jesus as the Messiah. They were like a fresh start for Israel.

\p \k 666\k*\im The number of the beast from the sea in Johnʼs vision. Thereʼs nothing special or evil about the number 666. The number 666 is a sign.

\p \k Adopted\k*\im When someone is made part of a family they were not born into. This is what happens when people trust in Jesus. God created human beings to live together with him in peace and love. They were meant to be children in his family. Humans didnʼt accept Godʼs love but chose to follow their own ways.

\p \k Covenant\k*\im An agreement or set of promises. In the Bible, itʼs usually between God and his people. Covenants were also made between people. Making a covenant showed that they promised to do what they had agreed to do. (See \k  Old covenant\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-18 \fk  Old covenant: \ft  The promises God made when he chose the nation of Israel to be his people. He made these promises first to Abraham. He made them again at Mount Sinai when he gave his laws to Moses. He made them again to King David. God promised to always be faithful to his people. He promised to bless them, protect them and give them land to live in. He promised to send the Messiah to save them from their enemies. His people were to worship and serve God only. They were to obey his laws.\ef* \xt  Romans 9:19-33\xt*. \k  New covenant\k*\ef -  \fr  26:17-30 \fk  New covenant: \ft  The set of promises God made when he invited all people to be in his family. God had first announced the new covenant through the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Then Jesus announced it and New Testament writers talked about it. Jesus is the Messiah God promised to send in the old covenant. Jesus gave up his life as a sacrifice to save people from sin and death. Then he was raised from the dead. This established the new covenant. All who trust Jesus to save them are part of his people. They are made right with God. This happens in peopleʼs hearts and changes the way they think and act. They are to follow Jesusʼ way of living. The Holy Spirit makes them able to do this.\ef* \xt  1 Corinthians 11:17-34\xt*.) \xt Matthew 4:1-11\xt*

\p \k Crucified\k*\im The process of dying on a cross. The Romans killed criminals this way. It was done in public to bring shame to the prisoners. It was also done to make others afraid to go against Roman laws. Crucifixion was very painful and usually slow. Roman soldiers could make death come quicker by breaking the legs of the criminals. (See \k  Cross\k*\ef -  \fr  16:13-27 \fk  Cross: \ft  Two pieces of wood put together so a person can be nailed onto it. The Romans killed criminals this way. This process is called crucifixion. The cross was a sign of terror and death. Here Jesus talked about the cross to show how his followers must be willing to suffer.\ef* \xt  Matthew 16:13-27\xt*.) \xt Mark 8:31\xt*
\p \k Curse of the law\k*\im There are two meanings to the curse of the law. The first means curses for not being faithful to Godʼs covenant. The law was part of Godʼs covenant with Israel. When they obeyed the law faithfully, they would enjoy many wonderful things (\xt  Deuteronomy 28:1-14\xt*). Those were called blessings. Not obeying the law faithfully led to people suffering in many ways (\xt  Deuteronomy 28:15-68\xt*). These were like punishments and were called curses. The second meaning of the curse of the law is about obeying the law. Jews were required to obey every part of the law faithfully. Since obeying all the laws was something no one could do, it was considered a curse. Jesus is the only human who has completely obeyed all of Godʼs laws. People who trust in him arenʼt required to obey all the Jewish laws. That is what it means for  to be freed from the curse of the law. \xt Galatians 3:1-14\xt*
\p \k Cyprus\k*\im A large island in the Mediterranean Sea west of Syria and south of Turkey. Prophets in the Old Testament mentioned Cyprus. The island was important in several of Paulʼs long journeys to share the good news. The  Barnabas and Mnason were from Cyprus. \xt Acts 13:13-41\xt*

\p \k Darkness\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word darkness. The first meaning is when the sun sets, and itʼs dark outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that are opposed to God. This darkness causes confusion and problems. It wants to destroy what God has made. Evil powers are often spoken about as the kingdom of darkness. \xt Matthew 4:12-17\xt*
\p \k Deacons\k*\im A follower of Jesus who serves in the church and helps other . Deacons work hard to help meet the needs of  in the church. The work of the first deacons is described in \xt  Acts 6:1-7\xt* and \xt  Acts 21:8\xt*. \xt Philippians 1:1-11\xt*

It means that people who are part of Godʼs kingdom on earth will never die. And people who refuse to join Godʼs kingdom will be separated from God for ever. \xt Revelation 20:1-15\xt*
\p \k Demetrius of Ephesus\k*\im A skilled worker who made silver models for worshipping Artemis. He opposed the Way of Jesus. He wanted people to worship Artemis so they would keep buying the models he made. He led a group of people in Ephesus to cause trouble for Paul. \xt Acts 19:21-41\xt*

The Holy Spirit protects Godʼs people from demons. He gives them power to drive out demons like Jesus did. (See \k  Devil\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Devil: \ft  An angel who stopped serving God. He is the leader of all spiritual powers. He opposes Godʼs work and Godʼs people. He is called the devil, the prince of this world, the prince of demons and Satan.

He is called the devil, the prince of this world, the prince of demons and Satan. He tells lies and accuses Godʼs people of doing wrong. He tries to make them be unfaithful to God.

The Bible described this like a star or lightening falling from heaven. \xt Revelation 12:1-17\xt*
\p \k Dressed in white\k*\im A way of describing when people are obeying God. The deeds people do show what they believe, what they worship and who they obey. When people believe in Jesus, worship him and obey him, they do good deeds. Deeds can be described like clothing on the outside of a person’s body. Other people see their deeds like they see their clothing. In the Bible, the colour white is a sign of things that are considered pure. In Revelation, people’s clothes become white by being washed in the Lamb’s blood. This means that people trust in Jesus to save them. \xt Revelation 2:18\xt* 
\p \k Edom\k*\im The land south of Judah where the family of Esau lived. Esau was called Edom, and his children became a strong nation also called Edom. Jacob and Esau were brothers, but the nations that came after them treated each other badly. \xt Mark 13:14-37\xt*

\p \k Eternal God\k*\im A way that the prophet Daniel described God the Father in one of his visions (\xt  Daniel 7:9-22\xt*). The name means that God has always existed and he always will exist. In Danielʼs vision, God was served by angels. He judged the enemies of his people. He gave the son of man a kingdom that would last for ever. \xt Revelation 1:9-20\xt*
\p \k Eternal life\k*\im This is life in the world to come that canʼt be destroyed by sin or death. It is life when God has won the battle over evil once and for all.

\p \k Eve\k*\im The second human being God created and the first female. Adam was her husband. She was the mother of Cain, Abel and Seth. \xt 2 Corinthians 11:1-15\xt*
\p \k Every tribe, people and nation\k*\im Every human being is invited to follow Jesus and become part of Godʼs people. This is true no matter what family, group or nation people come from. Itʼs true no matter what language they speak. Worshipping Jesus brings them together as one in Godʼs family. \xt Revelation 5:1-14\xt*
\p \k Evil magic.\k*\im The use of spiritual power that doesnʼt come from God. People use this power to try to control things or other people. They use this power to harm others or to protect themselves from harm. They also use it to try to make changes in the world. Often these changes seem to be miracles. In the ancient world people believed that this spiritual power came from gods and goddesses. They believed that the spirits of dead family members could help them use this power. They believed that this power was found in the natural world also. Many people still believe these things. They seek the help of gods, spirits or things in the natural world. God can work through spiritual beings and through the natural world. This blesses people. But spiritual power that doesnʼt come from God comes from Satan. Satan tricks people into trusting his power to protect them or make changes in the world. Satanʼs power is based on hating everything that God made and it is evil. Godʼs power is based on love. Only Godʼs power can protect people and make changes that are good for people. \xt Acts 8:9-25\xt*
\p \k Evil spirits\k*\im Spirits that God created but that turned against him. They work against God. Their power comes from Satan. They can use their power to control people and be inside them. When humans serve these spirits instead of God, they become slaves to sin and death. Evil spirits canʼt be inside of or control people who believe in Jesus and follow him. The Holy Spirit protects Godʼs people from evil spirits. He gives them power to drive out evil spirits like Jesus did. (See \k  Devil\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Devil: \ft  An angel who stopped serving God. He is the leader of all spiritual powers. He opposes Godʼs work and Godʼs people. He is called the devil, the prince of this world, the prince of demons and Satan. He tells lies and accuses Godʼs people of doing wrong. He tries to make them be unfaithful to God.\ef* \xt  Matthew 4:1-11\xt*. \k  Demons.\k*\ef -  \fr  4:18-25 \fk  Demons: \ft  Spirits that God created but who turned against him. They work against God. Their power comes from Satan. They can use their power to control people and be inside them. When humans serve demons instead of God, they become slaves to sin and death.

\p \k Faithful\k*\im There are several meanings for faith in the Bible. The first meaning is the things people believe about God. God wants all people to believe what is true about him. These are things God has shown about himself and ways he has acted. In the New Testament, these things include the message of good news about Jesus. The second meaning of faith is the belief itself. This is the trust that people have in God. It is based on their hope of how God will keep his promises. How strong peopleʼs faith is shows much they trust God. Their faith grows as they know God more and more. The third meaning of faith is how people live based on what they believe. Godʼs people are to follow Godʼs ways for living. Jesus showed people how to do this. Faith in Jesus includes following his example for living. \xt Matthew 4:1-11\xt*
\p \k Families\k*\im In the first century, families were usually led by older men. Families included older women, younger men and women and children. Slaves were also part of the household. The men had authority over women and children. Slave owners had authority over slaves. This system is what the nations of that time were based on. People who follow Jesus all belong to the family of God. Paulʼs letters and Peterʼs letters explained how Godʼs family is different than human families. Those with authority must use it to bless and serve others. Those who obey and serve must do so as if they are serving Jesus. Each family member is loved and accepted by God. So they must treat one another with respect and love. \xt Ephesians 5:21\xt*
\p \k Family lines\k*\im A written list of all the people in a family. These lists were very important in the ancient world. They are also called genealogies. It showed the history of a family line. 
\p \k Fasting\k*\im Going without food. People in Israel would do this to help them pay attention to prayer. They would also do fast to show that they were sorry for their sin.

Jesus taught that fasting was a common part of worshipping and serving God. \xt Luke 5:27-39\xt*
\p \k Father\k*\im One name for God. The Father is God just like Jesus is God and the Holy Spirit is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. God showed himself to be Israelʼs Father during the exodus and called Israel his son. Later, God showed himself to be the Father of Jesus. Jesus shows that God is the Father of all who are part of Godʼs family. \xt Matthew 3:13-17\xt*
\p \k Feast of Booths\k*\im Was also known as the Feast of Tabernacles. It was one of Israelʼs seven special feasts. It started five days after the day when the Jews made special sacrifices for sin. The people celebrated the harvest and how God provided for them. During the seven days of the feast, they slept in booths made from tree branches. This was to remember how they had lived in booths or tents in the desert. \xt John 7:1-36\xt*
\p \k Festus\k*\im The Roman governor of Judea and Samaria when Paul was in prison in Caesarea. \xt Acts 24:1-27\xt*
\p \k First century\k*\im The first hundred years in what many people call the AD time period. It comes right after the BC time period. Jesus lived in Israel then, around the time of 4 BC to AD 30. The Roman government ruled over Israel and many other nations during the first century. \xt Matthew 1:1-17\xt*
\p \k First covenant\k*\im The set of promises God made when he chose the nation of Israel to be his people. It is also called the first covenant. He made these promises first to Abraham.

They were to obey his laws. 
\p \k Four living creatures\k*\im Beings seen by the prophet Ezekiel and the apostle John in visions of heaven. Like the seraphs in Isaiahʼs vision of heaven they give  to God (\xt  Isaiah 6:2-4\xt*). They worship God and do what he wants done. \xt Revelation 4:1-11\xt*
\p \k Fruit of the Holy Spirit\k*\im Godly ways that people think, speak and act. These ways are the result of the Holy Spiritʼs work in peopleʼs lives. They show that people are following Jesusʼ example for living. \xt Galatians 5:13-26\xt*

\p \k Garden of Eden\k*\im The garden that God made when he created the world. Itʼs talked about in the book of Genesis. The first human beings lived there. God told them to take care of the garden and all that he had created. Life in the Garden of Eden was how God wanted his world to be. God and humans lived together in peace. Adam and Eve had to leave the garden when they stopped trusting and obeying God. \xt 2 Corinthians 11:1-15\xt*
\p \k Gentile\k*\im Everyone who wasnʼt a Jew. Gentiles werenʼt from Jacobʼs family line and hadnʼt accepted the Jewish faith. Most Gentiles in the first century didnʼt know about Israelʼs God or Israelʼs history. They didnʼt know about Jewish laws and didnʼt follow the Law of Moses (\xt  Matthew 5:13-20\xt*). \xt Matthew 15:21-28\xt*
\p \k Gerasene\k*\im A community that lived along the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. They didnʼt want Jesus to do his mighty works in their town. Mark and Luke call this community the Gerasenes. Matthew calls them Gadarenes. \xt Luke 8:22-39\xt*
\p \k Gifts\k*\im The Holy Spirit gives people the ability to do certain things well. These gifts are not something people can hold in their hands. They are spiritual gifts. Some gifts are teaching, taking care of others and healing those who are ill. Followers of Jesus use their gifts to encourage and strengthen the church. \xt 1 Corinthians 1:1-17\xt*
\p \k Giving\k*\im What people do when they recognise that God is the ruler with the most authority. It shows that people turn away from being proud and are humble before God. Prophets and others in the Bible urged people to give  to God. This was a way to warn them to stop sinning and to stop telling lies. King Nebuchadnezzar was a powerful example of learning to give  to God (\xt  Daniel 4\xt*). \xt Revelation 11:1-14\xt* 
\p \k Glory\k*\im The wonderful beauty and presence of God. Itʼs a way of talking about who God is and how pure and holy he is. Only the Creator has this . He chooses to share it with those he has created. Created beings show Godʼs  when they carry out his good plans for his creation. \xt Matthew 16:28\xt*
\p \k Gnosticism\k*\im A Greek idea that explained that the world had problems because people had bodies. Gnostics believed that human beings were saved by having secret knowledge. They believed this knowledge would allow them to escape the world they could see and touch. It would allow them to get rid of their bodies and enter into a spiritual world. Gnostics believed that only spiritual things that last for ever were good. Gnostics didnʼt believe that Jesus had a human body and was fully a human being. \xt 1 John 4:1-6\xt*
\p \k Go-between.\k*\im Someone who helps people or groups solve a problem they have with one another. This is also called a mediator. The problem is sin. Because human beings commit sin, they are unable to live in peace with God. Jesus is a human being and fully understands human beings. Jesus is also God and fully understands God. Jesus dealt with the problem of sin when he died on the cross. People can now be forgiven for sin and live in peace with God. This is how Jesus is the mediator between God and human beings. \xt 1 Timothy 2:1-7\xt*
\p \k gods\k*\im Anything that people worship that is more important to them than the true God. People worship things because they believe they have power. Satan uses their worship of these things to trap people and control them. The people groups in the Bible also made pictures or statues of some of these things. But the pictures or statues are objects that have no power. \xt Matthew 6:16-34\xt*
\p \k Godʼs kingdom\k*\im Godʼs rule as King on earth. Jesus announced the message about Godʼs kingdom. He taught about it through parables. It comes to earth in a slow process. It started through Jesusʼ work. It keeps spreading as the church continues to be faithful to Jesus. (See \k  Heaven\k*\ef -  \fr  6:16-34 \fk  Heaven: \ft  Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word heaven. The first meaning is the sky above the earth. The second meaning is where God the King and Creator rules and is worshipped. Heaven isnʼt a place that humans can travel to like places on earth. People canʼt fully understand or imagine heaven.\ef* \xt  Matthew 6:16-34\xt*.) \xt Matthew 4:12-17\xt*
\p \k Godʼs people\k*\im A way to talk about the nation of Israel. After Jesus came, anyone who follows him is considered part of Godʼs chosen people. (See \k  Israel\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Israel: \ft  The people group that God chose to show all other nations who God is. Before Jesus came, Israel included all the people from Jacobʼs family line. Jacob was also called by the name Israel. After Jesus came, anyone who follows him is considered part of Godʼs chosen people Israel. They didnʼt have to be from Jacobʼs family line. Israel also was the name of the land where Jacobʼs family lived after the exodus. After King Solomon died, only the northern part of that land was called Israel.\ef* and \k  Jews\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Jew: \ft  The name refers to people from the tribe of Judah and family line of Jacob. Jacob was Abrahamʼs grandson.\ef* \xt  Matthew 1:1-17\xt*.) \xt Matthew 1:18-25\xt*

Jesus is the Immanuel who saves Godʼs people from sin and death. \xt Matthew 28:16-20\xt*
\p \k In Jesusʼ name\k*\im People can do something in the name of someone else. When they do this, it means they are doing it with that personʼs authority.

In a similar way, Jesus had chosen 12 Jewish apostles to do special work. They were the start of Godʼs people who trusted Jesus as the Messiah. They were like a fresh start for Israel.

\p \k Jerusalem that is above.\k*\im The city the prophet John saw in the visions God showed him about the future. In Jerusalem in Israel, God was present in a special way in the temple. But in the new Jerusalem of the future, God will be fully present everywhere. He will live with human beings for ever. There will be no suffering or death or sin there. Life will be the way God always wanted it to be for his creation. It is called the bride of the Lamb because all of Godʼs people live there.

\p \k Jesus\k*\im The human being who is Godʼs Son and is the Saviour of the world. Jesus is God just like the Father is God and the Holy Spirit is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. In the Hebrew language, Jesus means the Lord saves. When he lived on earth, Jesusʼs mother was Mary. Joseph was the human father who raised Jesus when he was young. Jesus grew up in Nazareth with brothers and sisters. He died and then God raised him from the dead. Now Jesus rules as King in heaven. He will return to earth to rule as King over everything God created.
\p \k Jesusʼ letters to seven churches.\k*\im Jesus commanded John to send his message to each church as a letter. Each letter began by describing Jesus in a different way.

\p \k Jewish laws\k*\im The Jewish way of life was based on Jewish laws. Many of these laws came from the Law of Moses. Jewish religious leaders also added laws and rules to those earlier laws. Some of these extra laws and rules helped people obey the Law of Moses. Others made life very difficult for Jews. Certain religious leaders used the laws to control what people did. They also used them to make themselves look better. They did this to make it appear that God favoured them over other people. (See \k Law\k*\ef -  \fr  5:13-20 \fk  Law or Law of Moses: \ft  Godʼs instructions for his people about how to live and share his life with others. God gave these instructions to Moses. Some of the laws are about worshipping God in proper ways. Other laws are about how people should treat one another. Other laws deal with how they should live together in communities and as a nation. The Ten Commandments were the first laws God gave Moses. All the laws are recorded in the first five books of the Old Testament. All together, these five books are called the Law or Law of Moses.

Jezebel had been a queen of Israel who led the people to worship false gods. This false prophet was doing the same thing in Thyatira. \xt Revelation 2:18\xt* 
\p \k John the Baptist\k*\im One of Jesusʼ relatives. The angel Gabriel announced his birth. His parents were Elizabeth and Zechariah. He lived in the desert and ate locusts and honey.

He will show if their thoughts, desires and actions agree with what he wants for his world. He will show if they have followed his ways. He will fully separate evil from good.

\p \k Judgement day\k*\im The time in the future when God will judge all humans and all spiritual beings. He will show if their thoughts, desires and actions agree with what he wants for his world. He will show if they have followed his ways. He will fully separate evil from good. He will completely destroy for ever all that is evil.

He played instruments and wrote songs and poems. God made a covenant with David that someone from his family line would rule Israel for ever. The one who would fulfil that covenant is Jesus Christ. (See \k  Son of David\k*\ef -  \fr  9:18-38 \fk  Son of David: \ft  A name used for Jesus to show he was Israelʼs true King and Messiah. God had promised King David that his kingdom would last for ever. This would happen because someone from his family line would be the messiah. Jesus was the promised ruler from Davidʼs family. (See \w  King David\w* \xt  Matthew 1:1-17\xt*.)\ef* \xt  Matthew 9:18-38\xt*.) \xt Matthew 1:1-17\xt*  
\p \k Korah\k*\im A man born a Hebrew slave who was freed when Moses led the exodus. In the desert, he led many people to oppose Moses and Aaron. God destroyed him and those who followed him.

\p \k Lake of burning sulphur\k*\im The place of punishment John saw in visions he recorded in Revelation. The beast, the false prophet, Death, Hell and all who opposed Jesus were thrown into it. John called it the second death. The lake was a picture of Godʼs judgement. It was his judgement against evil spiritual powers and those who serve them. It showed that they would have no part in Godʼs kingdom on earth. \xt Revelation 20:1-15\xt*
\p \k Lamb of God\k*\im What John the Baptist called Jesus. Lambs were used in Jewish worship practices as a sacrifice for sin. During the first Passover, the blood of lambs saved the Israelites from being destroyed. John was saying that Jesus is the lamb who will save Godʼs people. \xt John 1:19-34\xt*
\p \k Lamb that looked as if he had been put to death.\k*\im John the Baptist called Jesus the Lamb of God (\xt  John 1:29\xt*). In Revelation, Jesus looked to the apostle John like a Lamb that had been killed. Yet the Lamb was alive. This is because Jesus was raised from the dead. At the same time, Jesus looked like a lion to John. With strength and power like a lion, Jesus won the victory over Godʼs enemies. Yet he won it by being weak and humble like a lamb. Jesusʼ victory came through the power of love that sacrifices everything for others. \xt Revelation 5:1-14\xt*
\p \k Lambʼs anger\k*\im The Bible describes God as angry at sin and evil. He shows his anger by stopping those who refuse to stop doing evil. He also shows it by judging them for what they have done. Writers in the Bible described Godʼs anger like a winepress. In a winepress, grapes are crushed to make wine. Writers in the Bible also described Godʼs anger like a cup of wine. Those who refused to stop doing evil had to drink it. These were pictures of how God stops those who do evil and punishes them. People who believe in Jesus are set free from the power of sin and evil. Because of this, they are saved from Godʼs anger against sin and evil. In Revelation, Godʼs anger and the Lambʼs anger are the same thing (\xt  Revelation 6:16\xt*). \xt Revelation 6:9-17\xt*
\p \k Laodicea\k*\im A city in the Roman territory of Asia Minor in what is now called Turkey. It was near Colossae. Epaphras shared the message about Jesus there and helped start a church. Paul wrote the Laodicean church a letter. The church in Laodicea is one of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation. \xt Colossians 4:7-18\xt* 
\p \k Last day\k*\im What Jews called the time when God will judge all people. It will be the last day of the way things are in the world. It will end what Jews called the present evil time. It will be the start of the world to come. All who are faithful to God before they die will be raised from the dead. The Jews didnʼt know when this day would come. (See \k  Judgement day\k*\ef -  \fr  19:16-30 \fk  Judgement day: \ft  The time in the future when God will judge all humans and all spiritual beings. He will show if their thoughts, desires and actions agree with what he wants for his world. He will show if they have followed his ways. He will fully separate evil from good. He will completely destroy for ever all that is evil. All that is good will exist for ever in peace and joy with God.\ef* \xt  Matthew 19:16-30\xt*.) \xt John 11:17-45\xt*
\p \k Last days\k*\im The period of time before God judges the world. Old Testament prophets had spoken about this time. God would act powerfully to save his people from their enemies. He would send his Spirit to those who worship him. New Testament writers described the time after Jesusʼ resurrection as the last days. Itʼs the time the church lives in until Jesus returns to earth as King. \xt Acts 2:14-41\xt*
\p \k Latin language\k*\im The language spoken by the Romans who ruled Israel during Jesusʼ time and after. Acts 12:25\xt*
\p \k Law that gives freedom\k*\im A way that James described the good news about Jesus. The good news is that Jesus brings people back to God.  donʼt have to follow the Law of Moses to be made right with God. In this way, Jesus sets them free from Jewish laws. He also sets people free from the power of sin. Then they are free to obey God. They are free to love and serve others the way Jesus taught his followers to do. By doing this they follow Christʼs law. Christʼs law is based on Godʼs mercy towards people who believe in Jesus. \xt James 1:19-27\xt*
\p \k Law\k*\im Godʼs instructions for his people about how to live and share his life with others. God gave these instructions to Moses. Some of the laws are about worshipping God in proper ways. Other laws are about how people should treat one another. Other laws deal with how they should live together in communities and as a nation. The Ten Commandments were the first laws God gave Moses. All the laws are recorded in the first five books of the Old Testament. All together, these five books are called the Law or Law of Moses. They tell about the beginning of the world and of the people of Israel. (See \k  Moses\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Moses: \ft  A Hebrew or Jewish slave who grew up in the royal palace in Egypt. God appeared to him in the desert and gave him special work. Moses led Godʼs people out of slavery, through the desert and to their new land. God gave instructions to Moses as to how his people should live. These instructions are recorded in the first five books of the Old Testament. These instructions are called the law or the Law of Moses (\xt  Matthew 5:13-20\xt*).\ef* \xt  Matthew 4:1-11\xt*. \k  Jewish laws\k*\ef -  \fr  26:57-68 \fk  Jewish laws: \ft  The Jewish way of life was based on Jewish laws. Many of these laws came from the Law of Moses. Jewish religious leaders also added laws and rules to those earlier laws. Some of these extra laws and rules helped people obey the Law of Moses. Others made life very difficult for Jews. Certain religious leaders used the laws to control what people did. They also used them to make themselves look better. They did this to make it appear that God favoured them over other people.\ef* \xt  Matthew 26:57-68\xt*). \xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*
\p \k Lazarus\k*\im The brother of Martha and Mary. The family were special friends of Jesus. After Lazarus had been buried for four days, Jesus brought him back to life. \xt John 11:1-16\xt*
\p \k Letter\k*\im A common way that people shared written messages with one another in the first century. Most of the books in the New Testament are letters. The letters are to churches or to certain . They teach about Jesus and how to follow him faithfully. The letters talk about things happening in the lives of the  and the churches. Most New Testament letters were read aloud and were shared with many churches. It was common for writers to speak out loud what they wanted to say. Then a secretary would write the words down. A believer who was traveling would take the letter to the people it was for. \xt Romans 1:1-17\xt*
\p \k Levi\k*\im One of Jacobʼs 12 sons. All priests in Israel came from Leviʼs family line. All males in Leviʼs tribe had special work to do. They took care of the holy tent and later the temple. Leviʼs tribe didnʼt receive land when the nation of Israel started living in Canaan. God provided for them from what the other tribes had. (See \k  Jacob\k*\ef -  \fr  9:1-18 \fk  Jacob: \ft  Isaacʼs youngest son and a grandson of Abraham. He was Esauʼs twin brother and was also given the name Israel. The 12 tribes of Israel are named after his sons and grandsons.\ef* \xt  Romans 9:1-18\xt*.) \xt Hebrews 7:1-28\xt* 
\p \k Light to the Gentiles\k*\im Words from prophecies in the book of Isaiah about Godʼs servant who suffered. (\xt  Isaiah 42:6\xt* and \xt  Isaiah 49:6\xt*.) In these prophecies, God said what his special servant would do. The servant would make sure that Godʼs covenant and salvation reached all peoples and not just Jews. This is what it means for the servant to be  a light for the Gentiles. Simeon the prophet understood that Jesus is the Servant from the prophecies in Isaiah. In \xt  Luke 2:30-32\xt*, Simeon recognised that Jesus brought Godʼs light and salvation to Gentiles. Paul and Barnabas understood that they were to bring light for the Gentiles too (\xt  Acts 13:47\xt*). They did this by sharing the message about Jesus with Gentiles. In \xt  Acts 26:23\xt* Paul preached about how Jesus brought the message of Godʼs light. He brought it to Jews and Gentiles. Jesusʼ followers have the honour of sharing Jesusʼ light and salvation with the whole world. \xt Luke 2:21-38\xt*
\p \k Light\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word light. The first meaning is when the sun is shining and there is light outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that agree with God. Light includes things that show or do what God wants for his world. It includes peace, understanding, health, and goodness. Godʼs light works to free Godʼs world from evil powers that are described as darkness. The time when God rules as King is talked about as the kingdom of light. \xt Matthew 4:12-17\xt*
\p \k Lion of the tribe of Judah.\k*\im A way to talk about Jesus being the Messiah and the most powerful ruler of everything and everyone. Jesus was from the family line of Jacobʼs son Judah. Jacob had described Judah as a lionʼs cub and a lion in \xt  Genesis 49:9\xt*. He prophesied that one of Judahʼs sons would rule as king. Jews understood this as a prophecy about the Messiah. \xt Revelation 5:1-14\xt*
\p \k Living water\k*\im A way of talking about how God provides everything people need. Water is living when itʼs fresh and moving. Plants and animals can live in it and people can drink it to stay alive. Old Testament prophets described God as a spring of water that gave Israel life (\xt  Jeremiah 2:13\xt* and \xt  17:13\xt*). They described him as a shepherd who led his people to springs of water (\xt  Isaiah 49:10\xt*). And they described how water would flow out of Jerusalem and give life to the world (\xt  Zechariah 14:8\xt*). In the New Testament, Jesus described the Holy Spirit as living water. Jesus gives living water to people who believe him (\xt  John 4:10\xt*). This means he shares the Holy Spirit with them. The Spirit provides what their spirits need in the same way that water provides what their bodies need. The Spirit helps them serve others. This is how the living water flows out from inside of people (\xt  John 7:38\xt*). In Revelation, God offers the water of life freely to everyone. \xt John 4:7-26\xt*
\p \k Lord Jesus Christ\k*\im A title for Jesus that describes him in many ways. As Lord, he has authority over all other rulers on earth. As Jesus, he is a Jew who lived in the first century and is Godʼs Son. As Christ, he is the Jewish Messiah and King. The title Lord Jesus Christ means that Jesus is the King of everything. It means he is the Saviour who rescues Godʼs people and the natural world. He rescues them from sin, death, and evil. It means he is worthy of worship because he is God. \xt 1 Corinthians 1:1-17\xt*
\p \k Lord\k*\im The word for master in the Greek language. It was used to show respect for men who had authority. The word lord was used for the Roman emperor. It meant he had authority over everything and everyone. Jesus is called Lord in a special way. His followers called him Lord. This showed that he had the highest authority over everything and everyone. By calling Jesus Lord they challenged the authority of Caesar. \xt Matthew 3:1-12\xt*
\p \k Lordʼs Day\k*\im What John the writer of Revelation called the first day of the week. It is the day of the week when Jesus was raised from the dead. The first churches started gathering to worship God on the first day of the week. Many  celebrate the Lordʼs Day on Sunday. In the Bible, it is the day after the Sabbath day. \xt Revelation 1:9-20\xt*
\p \k Lordʼs Supper\k*\im The meal that Christians share together to remember Jesusʼ death. Itʼs based on the last supper that Jesus shared with his disciples before he died. Itʼs also based on the Jewish Passover Feast. The meal includes eating bread and drinking wine. These remind  that Jesus gave his body and his blood to save all people. \xt 1 Corinthians 11:17-34\xt*
\p \k Lot\k*\im Abrahamʼs nephew who travelled with Abraham throughout Canaan. He chose to live in the Jordan River valley near the city of Sodom. When Sodom was going to be destroyed, angels rescued Lot and his family. The Moabites and Ammonites were from Lotʼs family line. \xt Luke 17:20-37\xt*
\p \k Luke\k*\im The writer of the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts. He was a doctor who travelled and worked with the apostle Paul. \xt Luke 1:1-4\xt*
\p \k Lystra.\k*\im A city in the Roman territory of Galatia in Asia Minor. Paul visited it on three of his long journeys to share the good news about Jesus. Paulʼs friend Timothy who worked with him was from Lystra. Many Jews from Lystra opposed Paulʼs work and tried to stop him. Paulʼs letter to the Galatians was probably read to the church there. \xt Acts 14:8-18\xt*
\p \k Macedonia\k*\im A Roman territory in the area that is now northern Greece. (See \k  Greek\k*\ef -  \fr  7:24-37 \fk  Greece: \ft  A kingdom that was very powerful in the years between the Old and New Testaments. Greek rulers controlled Israel and Jerusalem for a time. Then Roman armies took control of the lands ruled by the Greeks. But Greek ways of thinking and acting lasted even during Roman rule. The Greek language was spoken by people in areas all around the Mediterranean Sea. The New Testament was written in Greek.\ef* \xt  Mark 7:24-37\xt*.) Paul travelled there on his second big journey. He helped start churches in several cities in Macedonia. \xt Acts 16:1-10\xt*
\p \k Malachi\k*\im A prophet in the time after the Jews returned to Jerusalem after they were forced to live in Babylonia. His prophecies are recorded in the book of Malachi. \xt Luke 7:18-35\xt*

The  man of sin is like someone in the prophet Danielʼs vision (\xt Daniel 7:11,25)\xt*. \xt 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12\xt*
\p \k Manna\k*\im Something like bread that appeared on the ground while Godʼs people were in the desert. God sent it to them six days a week. It fed them during the great exodus. It was their food after they left Egypt until they came to their new land. \xt John 6:22-59\xt*

\p \k Mary\k*\im A young woman from Nazareth who served God faithfully. She had promised to marry a man named Joseph. She became pregnant even though she hadnʼt had sex with a man. The power of the Holy Spirit made this possible. She was the human mother of Jesus the Messiah. \xt Matthew 1:18-25\xt*
\p \k Mary\k*\im The sister of Lazarus and Martha. The family were special friends of Jesus. They lived outside of Jerusalem in Bethany. Jesus would stay at their house. Mary poured expensive perfume on Jesusʼ head to show her deep love for him. \xt Luke 10:38-42\xt*

\p \k Melchizedek\k*\im A priest of God who was the king of Jerusalem in Abrahamʼs time. Abraham honoured him by giving him a tenth of everything he won in a battle. \xt Hebrews 7:1-28\xt* 
\p \k Mercy\k*\im Tender love or kindness toward someone who is struggling in some way. God is full of mercy towards people and shows his kindness in many ways. One of the biggest examples of his mercy is how he forgives peopleʼs sin. \xt 2 Corinthians 5:11\xt*

\p \k Michael\k*\im One of the leaders of the angels who serve God. God gave him authority in the heavenly world. Daniel talked about how Michael served and guarded the people of Israel ( \xt  Daniel 10,12\xt*). In Revelation, John talked about Michael fighting a battle against the dragon who opposed God. Jude told a story about Michael based on a Jewish writing in the first century. \xt Jude 1:5-16\xt*   
\p \k Miracles\k*\im A mighty work from God who has full power to do anything in his creation. Jesus performed Godʼs mighty works when he was on earth. He gave his followers the power to do miracles also. \xt Matthew 14:13-21\xt*
\p \k Moses\k*\im A Hebrew or Jewish slave who grew up in the royal palace in Egypt. God appeared to him in the desert and gave him special work. Moses led Godʼs people out of slavery, through the desert and to their new land. God gave instructions to Moses as to how his people should live.

\p \k Most Holy Room\k*\im A room where the ark of the covenant was kept. This room was first in the holy tent and later in the temple. God was present among the Israelites there. A curtain separated it from the rest of the tent or temple. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Room. He did this once a year. \xt Hebrews 10:1-25\xt*
\p \k Mount of Olives\k*\im A group of three peaks on the east side of Jerusalem. It is separated from Jerusalem by the Kidron Valley. There was an olive garden where Jesus often went to teach his disciples and pray. After he was raised from the dead, he was with his disciples on the Mount of Olives. Then he was taken up into heaven and they didnʼt see him anymore. \xt Luke 22:47-62\xt*

\p \k Mystery of Christ.\k*\im The truth about how God accomplishes his plan for the world through Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, a mystery is usually something that hasnʼt been made known to people. Old Testament prophets had said that God would save his people. But Jews didnʼt know exactly how or when God would do this. They werenʼt sure who or what they would be saved from. They didnʼt know exactly who would be saved. Paul explained this mystery in his letters. Godʼs plan was to save all people who trust in Jesus. He saves them from the power of sin, evil and death. He saves them through what Jesus did when he sacrificed himself on the cross. \xt Ephesians 3:1-13\xt*
\p \k Nathanael\k*\im One of Jesusʼ 12 disciples. He was called Bartholomew in the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. He was from the town of Cana. \xt John 1:35-51\xt*

\p \k Neighbours\k*\im Throughout the Bible, neighbour is a way of talking about other people. Godʼs people understood that all other Israelites were their neighbours. They treated them better than they treated outsiders. (See \k  Outsiders\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Outsider: \ft  Anyone who doesnʼt belong in a place or to a group. In Jesusʼ time, anyone who wasnʼt part of Jacobʼs family line was an outsider. They were also called sinners. People who were considered unclean according to Jewish laws were treated like outsiders. Outsiders couldnʼt be a part of their community or worship God together with others in the temple.\ef*  \xt  Matthew 1:1-17\xt*.) In the New Testament, Jesus taught that all humans are neighbours to one another. All people are to be treated with love and respect. \xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*
\p \k New covenant\k*\im The set of promises God made when he invited all people to be in his family. God had first announced the new covenant through the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Then Jesus announced it and New Testament writers talked about it. Jesus is the Messiah God promised to send in the old covenant. Jesus gave up his life as a sacrifice to save people from sin and death. Then he was raised from the dead. This established the new covenant. All who trust Jesus to save them are part of his people. They are made right with God. This happens in peopleʼs hearts and changes the way they think and act. They are to follow Jesusʼ way of living. The Holy Spirit makes them able to do this. \xt Matthew 26:17-30\xt*
\p \k New song\k*\im Offering praise and thanks to God for what he has done. Many psalms talk about singing new songs to God. These are based on a person or group seeing Godʼs mercy in new ways. They are based on the special relationship each person or group has with God. \xt Revelation 14:1-5\xt*

\p \k Old covenant\k*\im The promises God made when he chose the nation of Israel to be his people. He made these promises first to Abraham. He made them again at Mount Sinai when he gave his laws to Moses. He made them again to King David. God promised to always be faithful to his people.

The Bible uses the olive tree as a symbol or a picture to explain other things. The leaves are a picture of peace (\xt  Genesis 8:11\xt*). The oil is used for holy things such as anointing people. Itʼs a symbol of Godʼs Spirit (\xt  Zechariah 4\xt*). Olives are crushed to release the oil when making olive oil. This is a picture of how Jesus was crushed when he suffered before he died (\xt  Matthew 26:36-46\xt*). The trees are also a picture of the people of God. \xt Romans 11:1-24\xt*
\p \k Onesimus\k*\im A slave in Colossae who ran away from his master Philemon. His name in the Greek language means useful. He met Paul and started following Jesus.

During the last plague, the oldest son in every Egyptian family was killed. God saved the Israelites from the plagues. The plagues were part of how he rescued his people from slavery in Egypt. \xt Revelation 8:6-13\xt* 
\p \k Pool of Bethesda\k*\im A pool of water in Jerusalem. In the Aramaic language, Bethesda means house of mercy. Water from the pool was used in the temple. Many people believed that the water from the pool would heal their illnesses. \xt John 5:1-15\xt*
\p \k Pray\k*\im The practice of talking with God and listening to God. \xt Matthew 6:1-15\xt*
\p \k Priest\k*\im A man from Aaronʼs family line who served in Godʼs holy tent or later in the temple. Priests made sacrifices for the people to God. They followed special laws about being pure. This allowed them to touch holy things. It also allowed them to be close to God in the holy tent or temple. People who werenʼt priests werenʼt allowed to do those things. \xt Matthew 12:1-14\xt*
\p \k Prophecy\k*\im An announcement about what God wants done or about what is going to happen. Prophets speak these messages from God. Many prophecies and stories recorded in the Old Testament point to Jesus. They show parts of Godʼs plan to rescue the world from evil, sin and death. They show Godʼs plan to send a Saviour. Writers in the New Testament talked about these stories and prophecies. They showed how Jesus is the Saviour God had promised to send. Godʼs promises come true through Jesus. Jesus completes the work God had been doing through Israel for hundreds of years. \xt Matthew 11:1-19\xt*
\p \k Prophesy\k*\im To speak a message from God or from Godʼs word. The Holy Spirit gives some  this ability. These messages are to be shared in an orderly way that people can understand. They are shared to help people who donʼt know God turn to God. They are also shared to help  understand how to obey God faithfully. Some messages are about what will happen in the future. Others help  understand how God is working right now. All of the messages encourage  as they do Jesusʼ work on earth. \xt Luke 1:57-80\xt*
\p \k Prophet\k*\im A person God chooses to speak through. Prophets take a message from God to their people or to other nations. \xt Matthew 3:1-12\xt*
\p \k Prophets\k*\im Many of the prophets God sent to Israel wrote down their messages. These writings are in the Old Testament and are called the Prophets. \xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*
\p \k Prostitute\k*\im A person who has sex with others in exchange for payment of some kind. Some people are prostitutes because they have no other choice. This happens with slaves or people who live under someone elseʼs control. Some people choose to be prostitutes. Itʼs how they want to make money. Writers in the Bible talk about people who choose to be prostitutes. They are a sign for people or groups who try to make other people sin. They are also a sign for not being faithful to worship only God. Marriage is one way that the Bible describes Godʼs relationship with his people. When his people serve other gods, itʼs like not being faithful in marriage. Itʼs like being a prostitute with false gods. God doesnʼt want any human being to be a prostitute with their body. He also doesnʼt want them to worship anything or anyone but him. \xt Revelation 17:1-18\xt*
\p \k Pure\k*\im Ways that the Bible describes what is or isnʼt acceptable to God. Things are considered pure when they are according to what God wants. Things are considered impure when they go against what God wants. Peopleʼs thoughts, words and actions can be pure or impure. The Bible also calls pure things clean and impure things unclean. Godʼs Spirit lives among people who live in pure ways. People who live in impure ways canʼt be near to God. In the Old Testament, God gave his people ways to be considered pure and clean. When Jesus came, his sacrifice on the cross made his followers pure. Jesusʼ followers remain pure by following his example for living. \xt 2 Corinthians 6:11\xt*
\p \k Rabbi\k*\im A male Jewish teacher. Rabbis usually studied the Scriptures in schools and were trained by other rabbis. People who wanted to learn from them and be like them would become their disciples. The disciples or students were usually only boys and men. Jesus was a rabbi even though he wasnʼt trained like rabbis of that time. Unlike other rabbis, Jesus welcomed both women and men as his students. \xt Matthew 7:24-29\xt*
\p \k Rahab\k*\im A woman from the city of Jericho in Canaan. She worked as a prostitute. She hid the spies sent by Joshua and kept them safe. When the Israelites destroyed Jericho, they saved Rahab and her family. She became part of Godʼs people and was Boazʼs mother. The story about her is in \xt  Joshua 2\xt* and 6.
\p \k Rainbow\k*\im The sign of Godʼs covenant with Noah. After the flood, God promised that he would never again destroy the earth with water. The rainbow was a sign of God having mercy on the world. \xt Revelation 4:1-11\xt*
\p \k Raised from the dead\k*\im Rising from the dead to live again. Jews disagreed about whether or not there would be a resurrection after people died. Jesus brought some people back to life again after they had died. Yet those people didnʼt live forever. They died again later on. That isnʼt what happened to Jesus. God raised Jesus from the dead in a new kind of resurrection. He lived a new kind of life in his body after that. He never died again. God will one day bring all people who have died back to life.
\p \k Repent\k*\im To turn away from sin and turn toward God. This isnʼt something that is done once and then never again. Humans sin even after becoming followers of Jesus. When they sin and are sorry for it, they ask God to forgive them. When people turn away from their sin, their relationship with God is healed. \xt Luke 13:1-9\xt*
\p \k Rest\k*\im In the Bible there are many meanings for the word rest. The first meaning is talked about in Genesis chapter 1. After God finished his work of creating the world, he rested. There was peace between God and what he created. Everything that existed had what it needed to live like God wanted it to. This was Godʼs rest. Another meaning is talked about in the Ten Commandments. It is the Sabbath rest. On the seventh day of the week, Jews were to rest instead of working. Another meaning is talked about in Psalm 95. It is the rest of the Israelites after they were freed from slavery. God brought them to the land he promised to give them. The full meaning is talked about in Hebrews chapters 3 and 4. Jesus brings true rest to those who believe in him. They begin to enjoy Jesusʼ rest when they start following him. They will enjoy it fully when he rules completely as King. \xt Hebrews 4:1-13\xt* 
\p \k Resurrection\k*\im Rising from the dead to live again. Jews disagreed about whether or not there would be a resurrection after people died. Jesus brought some people back to life again after they had died. Yet those people didnʼt live forever. They died again later on. That isnʼt what happened to Jesus. God raised Jesus from the dead in a new kind of resurrection. He lived a new kind of life in his body after that. He never died again. God will one day bring all people who have died back to life. \xt Matthew 16:13-27\xt*, \xt Matthew 16:28\xt*
\p \k Return to earth\k*\im When Jesus returns to earth to rule completely as King. After he was raised from the dead, he went to rule with the Father in heaven. When he returns, all people will recognise that he is Lord and King. Jesus will stop all evil on earth. He will bring heaven and earth together as one in Godʼs kingdom. \xt Matthew 1:1-17\xt*
\p \k Revelation\k*\im The name of the last book in the New Testament. The word means to reveal or uncover something. In the Greek language the word is apocalypse. Apocalyptic writing was common among Jewish and Christian prophets. In apocalyptic writing, prophets used signs and pictures. They used them to talk about things happening in heaven and on earth. The signs and pictures uncovered spiritual truths about those things. They helped people understand Godʼs point of view. They showed how God would save his people and judge their enemies. The signs and pictures in apocalyptic writing are often powerful or frightening. This was to get peopleʼs attention. \xt Revelation 1:1-8\xt* 
\p \k Right with God\k*\im Being set free from slavery to sin and made free to fully receive Godʼs love. It is as if someone had never turned away from God. People are made right with God by trusting him and having faith in him. This is also called being made righteous or being justified. \xt Romans 1:1-17\xt*
\p \k River Euphrates\k*\im A river about 2,800 kilometres long. It flows through the countries now called Turkey, Syria and Iraq. In Jesusʼ time, the Euphrates formed one of the borders of each of these countries. These countries were ruled by the Roman government. \xt Revelation 9:13-21\xt*
\p \k River Jordan\k*\im The biggest river in the land of Israel. Itʼs about 250 kilometres long. It flows north to south from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. \xt Matthew 3:1-12\xt*
\p \k Roman citizens\k*\im Being a citizen of Rome gave people certain rights. It protected them from being treated badly in certain ways. Roman rulers had to follow official Roman laws about citizens. Most of the people in lands controlled by the Roman government werenʼt Roman citizens. Being a citizen was special. \xt Acts 16:25-40\xt*
\p \k Roman rulers\k*\im The Roman government ruled over many other nations and peoples for several hundred years. It ruled over Israel during the first century. It was led by powerful emperors. People worshipped the emperor as a god. The capital city was called Rome. The Roman government treated most of the people it ruled over badly. \xt Matthew 16:1-12\xt*
\p \k Root of David\k*\im A way to talk about Jesus being the Messiah from Davidʼs family line. This name was like a name the prophet Isaiah had used in \xt  Isaiah 11:1-10\xt*. Isaiah described Jesseʼs family like the stump of a tree. He prophesied that a Branch would grow out of it. He was talking about a person who would rule fairly. Jews understood this as a prophecy about the Messiah. David was one of Jesseʼs sons. Jesus was from Davidʼs family line. That is how Jesus is the Branch of Jesse and the Root of David. \xt Revelation 5:1-14\xt*
\p \k Royal law\k*\im The Law of Moses about how people should treat others. God gave his people the laws in the Old Testament. Jews understood that God is the King of everything and rules with complete authority. That is why James called Godʼs law royal. \xt James 2:1-13\xt*
\p \k Royal Priest\k*\im A way of describing Jesusʼ followers. Jesus is King and is the great high priest. Those who follow him are part of Godʼs royal family in Godʼs kingdom. In this way they are royal. They serve God as priests. This means they can come near to God and be in his presence. They can pray to God and hear him speak to them. They help other people come to know God. In these ways they are royal priests.
\p \k Running away\k*\im In the first century, slaves who ran away were in serious trouble. They would often be hunted down and returned to their owners. They would usually be punished badly or killed. By law, Philemon had the right to punish or kill Onesimus. \xt Philemon 1:1-16\xt*
\p \k Sabbath day\k*\im The seventh day of the week for Jews. It was a holy day when faithful Jews rested and didnʼt work. It was to honour how God rested after creating the world. It also honoured the rest God gave Israel after freeing them from slavery in Egypt. It reminded Jews that God is good and wants his people to live in peace. The religious leaders had made many rules about what was allowed on the Sabbath day. These rules didnʼt always help people honour God. Jesus understood what God really wanted for his people on the Sabbath day. Even though the leaders opposed him, he did mighty works on the Sabbath day. \xt Matthew 12:1-14\xt*
\p \k Sacrifice\k*\im An offering given to God. In the New Testament, Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice. He gave up his life to pay for the sins of all people. His sacrifice makes people who believe in him right with God. His followers show they are thankful for his sacrifice by giving up many things. As they continue Jesusʼ work on earth, they give up money and things they own. They give up things they hope to do or to have. They may give up their lives. They offer these things to God because they are full of his love. They make sacrifices in order to do what is good for others.  \xt Matthew 26:57-68\xt*
\p \k Sacrificed\k*\im An offering given to God. Godʼs instructions in the Law taught his people to make sacrifices to him. They would offer God animals, crops and other things. They would bring them to the holy tent or the temple. Some sacrifices were sin offerings to pay for peopleʼs sins. That is how they would be forgiven and made right with God. Other sacrifices were to thank God for his blessings. \xt Luke 22:7-30\xt*
\p \k Sadducees\k*\im A group of Jewish religious leaders in the first century. They were in charge of the temple and worked closely with Roman rulers. They didnʼt believe in angels or that God raised people from the dead. And they didnʼt believe that Jesus was the promised Messiah. \xt Matthew 16:1-12\xt*
\p \k Salvation\k*\im When God comes and rescues his people. Jews were waiting for God to save them once and for all from their enemies. They thought their enemies were human armies or people who treated them badly. Jesus brings a bigger kind of salvation. When people trust in Jesus, he rescues them from the power of sin, death and evil. This is the beginning of their salvation. Everyone who believes in Jesus is saved for ever. Salvation will be complete when Jesus returns to earth. (See \k  Believe in Jesus\k*\ef -  \fr  12:38-50 \fk  Believe in Jesus: \ft  To trust that Jesus is who he says he is. Jesus is a human being and he is Godʼs Son. He died on a cross and God raised him from the dead three days later. When he rose from the dead, he won the victory over sin, death and evil. He is the true King of all that God created. Everyone who believes the truth about Jesus is saved from sin, death and evil. Jesus gives them life that never ends. People who believe in him obey him and follow his way of life.\ef* \xt  Matthew 12:38-50\xt*.) \xt Mark 11:1-11\xt*
\p \k Samaritan\k*\im The area of Israel between Galilee in the north and Judea in the south. The people who lived there were called Samaritans. They were the children of families that were a mix of Jews and other people groups. Those groups had come to Samaria when most Jews had been forced to leave Israel. They claimed to be Abrahamʼs true children. Jews and Samaritans usually treated one another like enemies. \xt Luke 9:51-62\xt*
\p \k Sanhedrin\k*\im The group of the 70 religious leaders with the most authority in Jesusʼ time. It was also called the Jewish Council. They looked after the temple in Jerusalem. There were two groups in the Sanhedrin. One group was the Pharisees and one was the Sadducees. The Sanhedrin opposed Jesus and the apostles who spread the news about Jesus being raised from the dead. \xt Matthew 26:57-68\xt*
\p \k Sarah\k*\im A woman from Mesopotamia who was Abrahamʼs wife. For many years she was unable to have children. God promised that she would have a son. When she was very old, she gave birth to Isaac. \xt Galatians 4:21-31\xt*
\p \k Sardis\k*\im An important city in the Roman territory of Asia. There was a temple to the goddess Artemis there. An earthquake had destroyed much of the city in the year AD 17. \xt Revelation 2:18\xt* 
\p \k Saul and Barnabas began their first journey to share the good news about Jesus.\k*\im Paul made several long journeys throughout lands ruled by the Roman government. Everywhere he went, he preached the good news about Jesus to Jews first. Then he preached to Gentiles. He helped start churches among those who believed in Jesus. He travelled with Barnabas on the first journey. He travelled with Silas on the second journey. He travelled with several helpers on the third journey. He travelled as a prisoner to Rome on his fourth journey. Each journey lasted more than a year.
\p \k Saul\k*\im The apostle called Paul in the Greek language. He was called Saul in the Hebrew language. To make money, he made tents. He was a committed Pharisee who tried to stop the church from growing. After Jesus appeared to him, he began spreading the good news about Jesus. The New Testament includes many letters he wrote to the early churches. \xt Acts 8:1-8\xt*
\p \k Saviour\k*\im A name for Jesus as the Messiah. He saves Godʼs people and Godʼs world from sin and death. \xt Matthew 1:18-25\xt*
\p \k Scriptures\k*\im In Jesusʼ time, the holy writings of the people of Israel. Itʼs also called the Old Testament. (See \k  Godʼs word\k*\ef -  \fr  15:1-20 \fk  Godʼs word or word of God: \ft  In Jesusʼ time, Godʼs word was understood to be the Jewish Scriptures of the Old Testament. For  in the New Testament times, Godʼs word also included Jesusʼ teachings. The apostles preached Godʼs word. This included the message about Jesus in the Old Testament and everything Jesus taught.\ef* \xt  Matthew 15:1-20\xt*. \k  Bible\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-18 \fk  Bible: \ft  The book of holy writings of Jews and Christians. For Jews, the Bible includes the books of the Old Testament. For Christians, the Bible includes the books of the Old and New Testaments.\ef* \xt  John 1:1-18\xt*.) \xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*
\p \k Sea of Galilee\k*\im A lake about 100 kilometres north of Jerusalem in the area of Galilee. Itʼs about 21 kilometres long and 12 kilometres wide. The Jordan River flows south from it. Many stories from Jesusʼ life happened around the Sea of Galilee. \xt Mark 6:45-56\xt*, \xt Revelation 13:1-18\xt*
\p \k Sea\k*\im In the beginning there was only darkness covering the water. This was a sign of the way things were. This was before God changed everything to the way he wanted it to be. Many stories in the Bible describe the sea as something to be feared. It was something people needed God to save them from. This includes the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. It includes Jonah when he was tossed into the sea. It includes Jesus when he calmed the storm on the sea. It includes Johnʼs vision in Revelation of the beast who came from the sea.
\p \k Seal\k*\im There are several meanings for the word seal in the Bible. The first meaning is to close something up or shut it. The second is to put into effect an agreement or covenant. The third meaning is a piece of sticky wax. People would put the wax on important scrolls or papers to close them. Only people with permission were supposed to break the seal and open the papers. The last meaning is an official or royal mark that shows who someone is. A seal that was pressed onto papers or other things left its mark on them. This showed that the person agreed to something or that it belonged to them. \xt Revelation 6:1-8\xt*
\p \k Second death\k*\im A way of describing Godʼs final judgement against those who refuse to follow him. They are destroyed and are separated from God for ever in the world to come. \xt Revelation 2:1-17\xt*
\p \k Servant of Jesus\k*\im Someone who follows Jesusʼ example of loving and serving others. Jesus is the King of all that God created. He came to earth to serve people so they would understand Godʼs love for them. The Holy Spirit gives Jesusʼ followers different gifts and abilities to use in serving others. When  serve others, they are also serving Jesus. All  are to be humble servants. \xt Romans 1:1-17\xt*
\p \k Servant who suffers\k*\im The one that God had promised to send to save Godʼs people. Isaiah 53 says that he would obey God and be a servant of God. He would suffer as he served Godʼs people. In Acts 3, Peter shows how this servant who suffered was the Jewish Messiah. Peter also shows how Jesus is this Servant and Messiah. \xt Matthew 8:1-17\xt*
\p \k Seven great signs\k*\im A way to describe chapters 2 to 12 of Johnʼs gospel. In these chapters John records seven mighty works that Jesus did. John calls them signs. The signs show that Jesus is the Messiah. The seven signs are listed in Main ideas in Johnʼs gospel. (See \k  Miracles\k*\ef -  \fr  14:13-21 \fk  Miracle: \ft  A mighty work from God who has full power to do anything in his creation. Jesus performed Godʼs mighty works when he was on earth. He gave his followers the power to do miracles also.\ef* \xt  Matthew 14:13-21\xt*.)
\p \k Seven\k*\im The number used in the Bible to talk about things being complete. It shows that things are finished and perfect. \xt Matthew 23:1-39\xt*
\p \k Shepherd.\k*\im Someone who takes care of sheep. It is also a way to talk about leaders who take care of other people. It was common in the ancient Near East to describe leaders as shepherds. In the Old Testament, Israelʼs leaders were described as being bad shepherds. God was the good shepherd for his people. In the New Testament, church leaders are to be shepherds of Jesusʼ followers. Jesus himself is the good shepherd of Godʼs people. \xt Mark 6:30-44\xt*
\p \k Silas\k*\im A leader among the  in Jerusalem who worked with Paul, Barnabas and Peter. He was a prophet and a Roman citizen. He helped take an important letter from the Jerusalem church to Gentile churches. He also helped Paul and Peter to write letters to churches. \xt Acts 16:1-10\xt*
\p \k Siloam\k*\im A place inside the walls of Jerusalem where there was a pool of fresh water. Siloam means sent. The first pool there was built by King Hezekiah. The Babylonians destroyed it, but it was rebuilt in Nehemiahʼs time. Water from the pool was poured on the altar during the Feast of Booths. The poolʼs water came from the Gihon spring. There was also a tower there that fell during Jesusʼ time and killed 18 people. \xt Luke 13:1-9\xt*
\p \k Simeon\k*\im A faithful Jew who had waited many years for the Messiah. God had promised him he would see the Messiah. He said a beautiful prayer when he held Jesus as a baby in the temple. He also prophesied to Mary about Jesusʼ life.  \xt Luke 2:21-38\xt*
\p \k Simon\k*\im A man from Cyrene who carried Jesusʼ cross when Jesus was about to be killed. Roman soldiers made him do this. Cyrene was in the country now called Libya in Africa. Many Jews who spoke the Greek language lived there. They would travel to Jerusalem for Jewish feasts. Simonʼs sons were named Alexander and Rufus. This Rufus might be the same Rufus Paul talked about in \xt  Romans 16:13\xt*. \xt Luke 23:26-43\xt*
\p \k Sin that lead to death\k*\im This kind of sin is separate from other sins. This one is when somebody willingly rejects Jesus, and those who follow him. The person who sins in this way does not ever want to hear about Jesus. They set their heart and mind to reject him as long as they live. That is how this sin leads to death. Both the personʼs body and their spirit die without accepting Jesus or having the desire to do so. \xt 1 John 5:1-21\xt*
\p \k Sin\k*\im Harmful thoughts, actions or desires that are against what God wants. These can be harmful to people themselves, to others and to Godʼs world. The Bible describes sin as a master and humans are its slaves. Sin is evil. Jesus is the only one powerful enough to destroy sin and free humans from its power. \xt Matthew 3:1-12\xt* 
\p \k Slaves\k*\im Large numbers of people worked as slaves in the lands controlled by the Roman government. The Roman way of life depended on the work done by slaves. Slaves could do nearly every job in a household. Many slaves did work that was hard and difficult. Some became doctors or managed their masterʼs money. As the good news about Jesus spread, many slaves and slave masters believed in Jesus. New Testament writers showed how the relationships between slaves and masters had to change. They showed how the good news doesnʼt allow for one human being to own another. Slaves and free people are accepted and loved by God equally. They are made one in Godʼs family by believing in Jesus. They are all servants of King Jesus. So both slaves and masters were to honour God in how they treated each other. New Testament writers didnʼt teach people to have slaves. They taught how slaves and masters were to treat one another after believing in Jesus. \xt Matthew 25:14-30\xt*
\p \k Smyrna.\k*\im An important city in the Roman territory of Asia. It was on the coast of the Aegean Sea. It is now part of the city called Izmir in the country Turkey. \xt Revelation 2:1-17\xt*
\p \k Sodom and Gomorrah\k*\im Towns south of the Dead Sea where the people were known for doing evil things. Abrahamʼs nephew Lot lived in Sodom. God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of their evil ways but saved Lot. \xt Jude 1:5-16\xt* 
\p \k Solomon\k*\im The son of David and Bathsheba who became king. He was king when the temple was built in Jerusalem. He was very wise and very rich. He stopped being faithful to God. This led to Israel and Judah separating into two kingdoms. \xt Matthew 12:38-50\xt*
\p \k Son of David\k*\im A name used for Jesus to show he was Israelʼs true King and Messiah. God had promised King David that his kingdom would last for ever. This would happen because someone from his family line would be the messiah. Jesus was the promised ruler from Davidʼs family. (See \k  King David\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  King David: \ft  The son of Jesse. David was a shepherd when he was young. He later became Israelʼs most famous king. His great-grandmother was Ruth, from Moab. He played instruments and wrote songs and poems. God made a covenant with David that someone from his family line would rule Israel for ever. The one who would fulfil that covenant is Jesus Christ.\ef* \xt  Matthew 1:1-17\xt*.) \xt Matthew 9:18-38\xt*
\p \k Son of Man\k*\im Someone who appeared in a vision that the prophet Daniel had (\xt  Daniel 7:13-15\xt*). In the vision, the son of man saved Israel from their enemies. Jesus called himself the Son of Man. It was a way to talk about how he is human and has Godʼs authority. As the Son of Man he would suffer. Then he would win victory over Godʼs enemies. He would do this for all humans.
\p \k Spain\k*\im A country in the western area of the lands ruled by Rome. Itʼs the same area now called Spain. Paul wanted to share the good news there. Itʼs the area farthest west that is mentioned in the Bible. \xt Matthew 16:28\xt*, \xt Romans 15:17-33\xt*
\p \k Speaking in different languages\k*\im When people speak out loud in a language they didnʼt know before. The Holy Spirit gives some  the ability to do this. Others listening to them may or may not speak the language. Unless someone can explain the message,  with this gift should speak only with God. Doing this will help them be close to God through prayer. \xt Acts 2:1-13\xt*
\p \k Spiritual armour\k*\im Tools that God gives his people to protect them from evil. These tools canʼt be held in peopleʼs hands. They are spiritual. They are described as armour or weapons because  use them in spiritual fights. Truth, godliness, peace, faith, salvation, Godʼs word and prayer are kinds of spiritual armour. These tools help  to be strong in their faith. They help them follow Jesus faithfully and say no to evil. \xt Ephesians 6:10-24\xt* 
\p \k Spiritual beings\k*\im Beings that donʼt have bodies like human beings or other creatures that live on earth. God is a spiritual being. He created all other spiritual beings. Some of them worship and serve him. Others have turned away from God and do evil. \xt Ephesians 1:15-23\xt*
\p \k Spiritual blessings\k*\im Gifts that God gives his people. These gifts are blessings. They canʼt be held in peopleʼs hands. They are the  riches in heaven that Jesus talked about (\xt  Matthew 6:19-21\xt*). There are many kinds of spiritual blessings. Wisdom, understanding, grace, hope and love are spiritual blessings. Being forgiven for sin and having eternal life are also spiritual blessings. People donʼt earn spiritual blessings but God gives them freely. \xt Ephesians 1:1-14\xt*
\p \k Spiritual fight\k*\im The battle of Satan and all evil spiritual beings against God. They want to destroy his plan for the world. One way they do this is by trying to make people turn against God. The fight occurs in the heavenly world that human beings canʼt see or touch. But humans are part of the fight through the choices they make. They make choices about who to worship and how to treat others. Worshipping God and acting according to his plan is how they fight against evil. \xt Ephesians 6:10-24\xt*
\p \k Statements\k*\im A way that Jesus told people who he is. Jesus used the words I am seven times in Johnʼs gospel in a special way. He was describing himself and the work he was doing on earth. I am are the same words God used when he told Moses his name (\xt Exodus 3:14\xt*).
\p \k Stephen\k*\im One of the seven leaders chosen by the  in Jerusalem to be a deacon. He made sure all the  had enough food. Many Jews were angry that he preached about Jesus. They killed him by throwing stones at him. He was the first of Jesusʼ followers to be killed for being faithful to Jesus. \xt Acts 6:8-15\xt*
\p \k Stoic\k*\im A group of thinkers who followed the teachings of the Greek thinker Zeno of Citium. They believed that people should live according to natural laws called the logos. The logos was understood as the force of reason that made the world work. Paul shared the good news about Jesus with Stoics in Athens. \xt Acts 17:16-34\xt*
\p \k Super-apostles\k*\im What Paul called certain Jewish leaders. These leaders opposed his work in the new churches he helped start. Compared to Paul, they seemed strong, successful, healthy and rich. They said bad things about Paul. They told people he didnʼt have the skills or authority to be a leader. They said he needed official letters from other leaders to prove he was an apostle. They told people he couldnʼt be trusted and wasnʼt good at sharing the message about Jesus. They said he didnʼt perform signs and wonders. They claimed that Paul was always causing trouble. They took advantage of new  and didnʼt serve people with love. They pretended to serve God but were actually serving Satan by doing evil. \xt 2 Corinthians 11:1-15\xt*
\p \k Sword\k*\im A sharp weapon people use for fighting. Writers in the Bible also described the words of people like swords. This showed how people can cause harm with their words (\xt  Psalm 55:21; 59:7,\xt*\xt  Proverbs 12:18\xt*). Writers in the Bible also described Godʼs word like a sword with two edges. This showed that Godʼs word uncovers what is inside peopleʼs hearts. It also showed that Godʼs word strengthens and protects  when they struggle against evil. In a special way, the words from Jesusʼ mouth were described as a sword. This was a picture of how Jesus himself is Godʼs word. Everything he speaks is the truth about God. Speaking truth about God is how he destroys Satanʼs lies about God. \xt Revelation 1:9-20\xt* 
\p \k Synagogue\k*\im Places where Jews in the first century would gather to worship God. They would read the Scripture on the Sabbath day. Jewish teachers called rabbis would teach the people after reading from the Law of Moses and the Prophets. (See \k  Law\k*\ef -  \fr  5:13-20 \fk  Law or Law of Moses: \ft  Godʼs instructions for his people about how to live and share his life with others. God gave these instructions to Moses. Some of the laws are about worshipping God in proper ways. Other laws are about how people should treat one another. Other laws deal with how they should live together in communities and as a nation. The Ten Commandments were the first laws God gave Moses. All the laws are recorded in the first five books of the Old Testament. All together, these five books are called the Law or Law of Moses. They tell about the beginning of the world and of the people of Israel.\ef* \xt  Matthew 5:13-20\xt*.) There were synagogues throughout the lands that were controlled by the Romans. \xt Matthew 9:18-38\xt*
\p \k Tax collector\k*\im Jews who collected money for the Roman government in Jesusʼ time. They werenʼt always honest. Often they made people give them more money than was required. The tax collectors would keep the money for themselves. Most Jews hated tax collectors for doing this and because they worked for their enemies the Romans. Tax collectors were often treated like outsiders. (See \k  Outsiders\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Outsider: \ft  Anyone who doesnʼt belong in a place or to a group. In Jesusʼ time, anyone who wasnʼt part of Jacobʼs family line was an outsider. They were also called sinners. People who were considered unclean according to Jewish laws were treated like outsiders. Outsiders couldnʼt be a part of their community or worship God together with others in the temple.\ef* \xt  Matthew 1:11-17\xt*.) \xt Matthew 9:1-17\xt*
\p \k Taxes\k*\im Money that a government requires people to pay. Those who live under the authority of that government pay this money. The leaders are supposed to use the money to take care of everyone. \xt Matthew 17:14-27\xt*
\p \k Teachers of the law\k*\im Jewish men who had studied the Scriptures and taught them to the people. People usually thought highly of these teachers and treated them with honour. Most of teachers of the law opposed Jesus and his work. \xt Matthew 9:1-17\xt*
\p \k Temple curtain\k*\im The thick cloth that separated the Most Holy Room from the rest of the temple. People couldnʼt walk behind it or they would die. The curtain was a sign of how humans were separated from God. When Jesus died, it ripped open. That was a sign that his death brought people close to God again. \xt Mark 15:16-39\xt*
\p \k Temple\k*\im The building that was used as a place to worship God and to meet with him. God told King David how it should be built. King Solomon built the first one. The Babylonians destroyed it. Many years later, the Jews built another one. Jesus called the temple his Fatherʼs house. After the Romans destroyed it in the year AD 70, the Jews never built another temple. \xt Matthew 4:1-11\xt*
\p \k Ten Commandments\k*\im The first laws that God gave Moses on Mount Sinai. God wrote them on stone tablets. They were the rules for Godʼs covenant with the people of Israel. The rest of the laws in the Old Testament were based on them. They are recorded in \xt  Exodus 20:3-17\xt* and \xt  Deuteronomy 5:7-21\xt*. (See \k  Law\k*\ef -  \fr  5:13-20 \fk  Law or Law of Moses: \ft  Godʼs instructions for his people about how to live and share his life with others. God gave these instructions to Moses. Some of the laws are about worshipping God in proper ways. Other laws are about how people should treat one another. Other laws deal with how they should live together in communities and as a nation. The Ten Commandments were the first laws God gave Moses. All the laws are recorded in the first five books of the Old Testament. All together, these five books are called the Law or Law of Moses. They tell about the beginning of the world and of the people of Israel.\ef* \xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*.) \xt 1 John 2:3-14\xt*
\p \k the one Jesus loved \k*\im What John the writer called himself in his gospel (\xt  John 13:23; 19:26-27; 20:2-5; 21:7; 20-24)\xt*. Throughout his gospel, John showed how much Jesus loves all the people of the world. He also showed how much Jesus loved his friends and his disciples. John didnʼt mean that Jesus loved him more than anyone else. The name showed that John was aware of Jesusʼ deep love for him.
\p \k Theophilus\k*\im The person that Luke wrote his gospel and the book of Acts for. The name Theophilus means lover of God. So what Luke wrote could be applied to anyone who loves God. Luke might have used the name Theophilus to talk about another Christian. He might have done this to keep the personʼs name a secret to protect them. Luke calls Theophilus most excellent (\xt Luke 1:3\xt*). This might mean that Theophilus was an official of the Roman government (\xt Acts 23:26; 24:3; 26:25)\xt*. \xt Luke 1:1-4\xt*, \xt Acts 1:1-11\xt*
\p \k Thessalonica\k*\im A Greek city the Roman territory of Macedonia. It was in the area that is now northern Greece. Paul travelled there on his second journey. His letters to the Thessalonians were written to the church there. \xt Acts 17:1-15\xt*
\p \k This evil world\k*\im The world that God created but that is ruled by Satan. What God created is good and not evil (Genesis 1). Yet Satan is evil and many people choose to follow Satanʼs evil ways. Jesus saves people from Satanʼs power. Until Jesus returns as King, his followers still live in the world ruled by Satan. But they serve Jesus and are under the power of the Holy Spirit. That is what it means to be  set free from this evil world. \xt Galatians 1:1-10\xt*
\p \k Thomas\k*\im One of Jesusʼ 12 disciples. He was also called Didymus, which means twin.
\p \k Thyatira\k*\im An important town in the Roman territory of Asia. It’s part of the city Akhisar in the country now known as Turkey. Lydia was from this city. \xt Revelation 2:18\xt*
\p \k Timothy\k*\im A young man who worked with Paul. His mother was a Jewish believer and his father was a Greek Gentile. The right to be Jewish came from the mother and not the father. So Timothy was considered a Jew. Paul trusted him and loved him like a son. Timothy served in many of the churches Paul helped start. He was with Paul when the apostle wrote many of his letters. The New Testament includes two letters Paul wrote to Timothy. \xt Acts 16:1-10\xt*
\p \k Titus\k*\im A man who worked and travelled with Paul. He was a Greek who followed Jesus and wasnʼt circumcised. He served in many of the churches that Paul helped start. He served in a special way on the island of Crete. He also helped take the offering given by the Corinthian  to Jerusalem. The New Testament book called Titus is a letter that Paul wrote to him. \xt 2 Corinthians 7:2-16\xt*
\p \k Treated badly\k*\im Many of Jesusʼ disciples and followers in the first churches were treated badly or killed. Other Jews made them suffer for following Jesus as the Jewish Messiah. They wanted Christian Jews to return to the Jewish faith and way of life. Roman authorities made them suffer for following Jesus as King of the whole world. They wanted Christians to recognise that the Roman emperor was king. The Roman government had laws that allowed people to practice the Jewish faith. But in the time of the first churches it didnʼt have laws about Christians. This meant that Christians could get in trouble for following Jesus. To avoid trouble, they could go back to living as Jews. This was one way to escape being treated badly. It was very tempting for Christians who were suffering. Many Christians today are also treated badly for faithfully following Jesus. (See \k  Sacrifice\k*\ef -  \fr  26:57-68 \fk  Sacrifice: \ft  An offering given to God. In the New Testament, Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice. He gave up his life to pay for the sins of all people. His sacrifice makes people who believe in him right with God. His followers show they are thankful for his sacrifice by giving up many things. As they continue Jesusʼ work on earth, they give up money and things they own. They give up things they hope to do or to have. They may give up their lives. They offer these things to God because they are full of his love. They make sacrifices in order to do what is good for others.\ef* \xt  Matthew 26:57-68\xt*.) \xt Matthew 10:16-42\xt*
\p \k Tree of life\k*\im The tree in the Garden of Eden that had fruit that let people live for ever. Human beings werenʼt allowed to eat from it after Adam and Eve sinned. In Revelation, John saw the tree in the new heaven and the new earth. Everyone who lived in Godʼs Holy City could eat of it freely. This meant that they had eternal life and lived for ever with God. \xt Revelation 21:22\xt*
\p \k Tribes\k*\im Jacob had 12 sons. The tribes were named after Jacobʼs sons and grandsons. These 12 family groups made up the nation of Israel. The families of Jacobʼs sons became very large tribes. God promised to give them the land of Canaan to live in. After many years, they were forced to leave that land. After that, it was no longer clear who or where all the 12 tribes were. In different parts of the Bible, the list of tribes includes different names. But they are all sons or grandsons of Jacob. Jews still talked about Godʼs people as the 12 tribes. (See \k  Jacob\k*\ef -  \fr  9:1-18 \fk  Jacob: \ft  Isaacʼs youngest son and a grandson of Abraham. He was Esauʼs twin brother and was also given the name Israel. The 12 tribes of Israel are named after his sons and grandsons.\ef* \xt  Romans 9:1-18\xt*.) \xt Luke 6:12-16\xt*
\p \k Trinity\k*\im There is only one real and true God. The one and only God is three persons. This is the Trinity. The three persons are God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. \xt Matthew 3:13-17\xt* 
\p \k Trumpets\k*\im In the Bible, trumpets were used for many purposes. They were used in worship services and in battles. Trumpets were used to make important announcements and as alarms. Jesus and Paul talked about trumpets being blown. Trumpets would announce when God gathered his people and raised them from the dead. In Revelation, angels blew trumpets to announce parts of Godʼs judgement against evil. \xt Revelation 8:6-13\xt*
\p \k Tyre and Sidon\k*\im Cities on the Mediterranean coast in the country now called Lebanon. The Phoenician people lived there first. The cities were later controlled by many different governments. The Israelites never took control of these cities when they moved into Canaan. Tyre was also a strong fort. There was peace between Tyre and Israel during the rule of some of Israelʼs kings. The people in Tyre and Sidon worshipped false gods and were known for doing evil things. \xt Mark 3:1-12\xt*
\p \k Ungodly\k*\im A way to describe people who donʼt worship and serve God. They worship false gods. They donʼt respect God or follow his ways. They try to get what is best for themselves and donʼt serve others. They also try to make others stop being faithful to God and his ways. God wants ungodly people to turn away from sin and be made right with him. God will raise ungodly people from the dead. He will judge them. \xt Jude 1:1-4\xt* 
\p \k Violent and confusing time\k*\im  The things Jesus described happened in the years after he was raised from the dead. Jesusʼ followers were treated badly by other Jews for being faithful to Jesus. Then in AD 70 Roman armies surrounded Jerusalem. They destroyed the temple and scattered the people. \xt Luke 21:5-36\xt*
\p \k Vision\k*\im When people see or hear something from the heavenly world (see \k  Heavenly world\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-13 \fk  Heavenly world: \ft  A way of talking about the world where spiritual beings exist. It isnʼt part of the earth where human beings live. It isnʼt part of the things humans can see, touch or study. That world includes spiritual beings like angels that worship and serve God. It also includes spiritual beings like demons that donʼt honour God.\ef* \xt  Ephesians 3:1-13\xt*). Visions are one way that God makes himself and his plans known to people. He appears to people and shows them something about who he is. He may also give them a message in the vision. The message may be just for the person who has the vision. Or God may want them to share the message with others. God can also send angels to appear to people in a vision. Visions can occur through dreams when people are asleep. People donʼt make visions from God happen. They are a gift from God. Some visions are from Satan and evil spirits. These visions are harmful and donʼt show the truth about who God is. Some people pretend to have visions. They do this to trick others with teaching that isnʼt true. Real visions from God always agree with the truth about who God is. \xt Acts 10:1-16\xt*
\p \k Way of Jesus\k*\im Believing that Jesus is the Messiah and following him. It includes trusting that Jesus rose from the dead and is King of the world. It includes obeying his teachings and following his example of how to live. \xt Acts 9:1-19\xt*
\p \k Winning the battle over the world.\k*\im Having victory over everything that opposes God. This includes sin, death, and all evil spiritual powers. Jesus won this battle by suffering, dying on the cross, and being raised from the dead. Because Jesus already won the battle, his followers share in his victory. They have victory over sin and evil by trusting in Jesus and following his example. \xt John 16:16-33\xt*
\p \k Wise Men\k*\im Important men from lands east of Israel. They studied the stars in the sky. After Jesus was born, they worshipped him as the true King of the world. \xt Matthew 2:13-23\xt*
\p \k Word\k*\im God spoke words to create the world. In his gospel, John says that the Word that created the world is Jesus. The Word is eternal. The Word has always lived and was never not living. The Word has always been with God. The Word is God and shows who God is. \xt John 1:1-18\xt*
\p \k Worked\k*\im After God created the first human beings, he gave them work. Work was a blessing for them. Their work was to take care of the Garden of Eden and the animals. Human beings are still responsible for taking care of the earth that God made. This shows how God created them to be like himself. God did his work of creation for six days. He rested on the seventh day. He wants people to follow his example of working and resting. God doesnʼt want people to be lazy. People must do their best to provide for themselves, their families and their communities. \xt 1 Thessalonians 4:7-18\xt*
\p \k World to come\k*\im The world that God will make new after he raises his people from the dead. The Bible speaks about  new heavens and a new earth (\xt  Isaiah 65:17; 66:22\xt* and \xt  Revelation 21\xt*). Before Jesus, Jews thought of it as when God would rescue them from all harm. Jesus taught that it was when all his followers would enjoy life with God for ever. Itʼs when Jesus will rule completely as King. \xt Mark 10:17-31\xt*
\p \k World\k*\im The place that God made for humans and all creation to live. God will one day make it new again. New Testament writers also used the word world when talking about evil. People can choose to follow the evil ways of the world. Or they can choose to serve Godʼs kingdom and follow Godʼs ways. \xt Matthew 3:13-17\xt*
\p \k Worship Rome and the emperor\k*\im The Roman government required people in its lands to worship Rome and the Roman emperor. This started happening more and more in the first century. New temples were built to honour Caesar as the son of god. There were special feasts and parades in the emperorʼs honour. Jesusʼ followers faced a lot of trouble because of this. It was common for those who didnʼt worship Caesar to be treated as outsiders. They werenʼt allowed to buy and sell in the marketplace. \xt Revelation 13:1-18\xt*
\p \k Zechariah\k*\im The father of John the Baptist. Elizabeth was his wife. He was a priest who served God faithfully but struggled to believe the angel Gabrielʼs words. When John was born, Zechariah spoke a beautiful prophecy. \xt Luke 1:5-25\xt*
\p \k Zechariah\k*\im A priest and prophet after the Jews came back from Babylonia to their homeland. His visions and prophecies are recorded in the book of Zechariah. This was a different Zechariah to the father of John the Baptist. \xt Matthew 27:1-10\xt*
