\mt1  The Gospel of Matthew 
\is1  Who is Matthew? 
\ili1   •  One of Jesusʼ disciples named Matthew wrote this gospel 
\ili1   •  Matthew was known as \it Levi\it* (\xt Matthew 9:9-10\xt*, \xt Mark 2:14-15\xt* and \xt Luke 5:27\xt*) 
\ili1   •  Matthew probably wrote this gospel in the years between AD 55 and 60 
\ili1   •  Matthew was a Jew. When Jesus chose him to be a disciple, he was working for the Roman government 
\ili1   •  Matthew collected taxes for the Romans. The Jewish community hated tax collectors because they charged the people extra money. 
\is1  Why did Matthew write his gospel? 
\ili1   •  Matthew wrote for people who were Jews. They were expecting the Messiah promised in the Old Testament to come. He wanted to prove to them that Jesus was that Messiah 
\ili1   •    The main purpose of Matthewʼs gospel is to show that Jesus is the Messiah 
\ili1   •    To prove this, Matthew includes many Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. He shows how these prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus 
\ili1   •    Matthew uses Old Testament prophecies about 65 times to describe what happened in Jesusʼ life. Matthew uses the Old Testament much more than the writers of the other gospels 
\ili1   •    Matthew shows how Jesus is faithful to the Old Testament Scriptures. His gospel does this more than any other book in the New Testament 
\ili1   •    God had made promises to King David about his people Israel. He had also made promises to Abraham about all people on earth. Matthew describes Jesus as the son of David and the son of Abraham. This shows that Godʼs promises to them have been fulfilled through Jesus Christ. 
\is1  Main Ideas 
\ili1   •    This book shows that Jesus is the Messiah and King the Jews have been waiting for 
\ili2   ○  The record of Jesusʼ family line from King David calls Jesus the \it  son of David.\it* This is important because the \it  son of David\it* was someone God had promised to send. That person would rule with King Davidʼs royal authority 
\ili2   ○  The Wise Men who worshipped Jesus were looking for the \it  King of the Jews\it*. 
\ili2   ○  The way Jesus entered Jerusalem shows he is a humble King who rides a donkey. 
\ili2   ○  The sign above Jesusʼ head on the cross calls him \it  King of the Jews\it* 
\ili2   ○  After his resurrection, Jesus is the King with \it  all authority in heaven and on earth\it* 
\ili2   ○  Jesusʼ authority as a teacher. The first 5 books of Jewish Scriptures were Mosesʼ teaching To show how important Jesusʼ new teaching is, Matthew records it in 5 long messages

\v 6 And Jesse was the father of King David. 
\b 
\li1 David was the father of Solomon. Solomonʼs mother had been Uriahʼs wife. 
\li1 
\v 7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. 
\li1 Rehoboam was the father of Abijah.

\li1 
\v 11 And Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon. 
\b 
\li4 
\v 12 After this, the family line continued.

\b 
\li4 
\v 17 So there were 14 generations from Abraham to David. There were 14 from David until the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon. And there were 14 from that time to the Messiah.
\im  \bd  1:1-17\bd* For \k Jews\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Jew: \ft  The name refers to people from the tribe of Judah and family line of Jacob. Jacob was Abrahamʼs grandson.\ef* in the \k first century\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  First century: \ft  The first hundred years in what many people call the AD time period. It comes right after the BC time period. Jesus lived in Israel then, around the time of 4 BC to AD 30. The Roman government ruled over Israel and many other nations during the first century.\ef*, \k family lines\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Family lines: \ft  A written list of all the people in a family. These lists were very important in the ancient world. They are also called genealogies. It showed the history of a family line.\ef* were very important. \k Jesus\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Jesus: \ft  The human being who is Godʼs Son and is the Saviour of the world. Jesus is God just like the Father is God and the Holy Spirit is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. In the Hebrew language, Jesus means the Lord saves. When he lived on earth, Jesusʼs mother was Mary. Joseph was the human father who raised Jesus when he was young. Jesus grew up in Nazareth with brothers and sisters. He died and then God raised him from the dead. Now Jesus rules as King in heaven. He will return to earth to rule as King over everything God created.\ef*ʼ family line shows that he was from \k Abrahamʼs\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Abraham: \ft  A man from Mesopotamia who became the father of the nation of Israel. He believed Godʼs promise that he would have a son. He was married to Sarah, and their son was named Isaac. God made a covenant with Abraham and all his children. Abraham had a second son named Ishmael.\ef* family. He was also from the royal family of \k King David\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  King David: \ft  The son of Jesse. David was a shepherd when he was young. He later became Israelʼs most famous king. His great-grandmother was Ruth, from Moab. He played instruments and wrote songs and poems. God made a covenant with David that someone from his family line would rule Israel for ever. The one who would fulfil that covenant is Jesus Christ.\ef*. Jews knew that the \k Messiah\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Messiah: \ft  The Saviour who would rescue the Jews from all their enemies. This true king would rule fairly. He would bring peace. He is also called the son of David.\ef* would come from these two family lines. 
\ip  There are stories in the \k Old Testament\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Old Testament: \ft  The first 39 books of the Bible. It includes the Law of Moses and books about Israelʼs history. It also includes the writings of the prophets, the psalms and books of wisdom.\ef* about many of the people in Jesusʼ family. Some of them are hard and painful stories. Some of these women and men werenʼt from \k Israel\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Israel: \ft  The people group that God chose to show all other nations who God is. Before Jesus came, Israel included all the people from Jacobʼs family line. Jacob was also called by the name Israel. After Jesus came, anyone who follows him is considered part of Godʼs chosen people Israel. They didnʼt have to be from Jacobʼs family line. Israel also was the name of the land where Jacobʼs family lived after the exodus. After King Solomon died, only the northern part of that land was called Israel.\ef* and were considered \k outsiders\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Outsider: \ft  Anyone who doesnʼt belong in a place or to a group. In Jesusʼ time, anyone who wasnʼt part of Jacobʼs family line was an outsider. They were also called sinners. People who were considered unclean according to Jewish laws were treated like outsiders. Outsiders couldnʼt be a part of their community or worship God together with others in the temple.\ef*. \k Matthew\k*\ef -  \fr  1:1-17 \fk  Matthew or Levi: \ft  The writer of the first gospel in the New Testament. He was one of Jesusʼ 12 disciples. He was also called Levi. He was a tax collector.\ef* was showing that Jesus is the Messiah for all people and will rule forever. God will work through him to forgive all people. Jesus will give people life that death canʼt destroy. 
\p 
\v 18 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about. His mother Mary and Joseph had promised to get married. But before they started to live together, it became clear that she was going to have a baby. She became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
\v 19 Her husband Joseph was faithful to the law. But he did not want to put her to shame in public. So he planned to divorce her quietly. 
\p 
\v 20 But as Joseph was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, ‘Joseph, son of David, donʼt be afraid to take Mary home as your wife. The baby inside her is from the Holy Spirit. 
\v 21 She is going to have a son. You must give him the name Jesus. Thatʼs because he will save his people from their sins.’ 
\p 
\v 22 All this took place to bring about what the Lord had said would happen. He had said through the prophet, 
\v 23 ‘The virgin is going to have a baby. She will give birth to a son. And he will be called Immanuel.’ (\xt Isaiah 7:14\xt*) The name Immanuel means ‘God with us.’ 
\p 
\v 24 Joseph woke up. He did what the angel of the Lord commanded him to do. He took Mary home as his wife. 
\v 25 But he did not sleep with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph gave him the name Jesus. 
\im  \bd  1:18-25\bd* In the story of Jesusʼ birth, Matthew recorded many things about who Jesus is. Jesus is the Messiah, and he comes from God. The \k Holy Spirit\k*\ef -  \fr  1:18-25 \fk  Holy Spirit: \ft  God shows himself to be the Spirit at the creation of the world. The Holy Spirit is God just like the Father is God and Jesus is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. The Holy Spirit worked through the humans who recorded the books of the Bible. The Holy Spirit made it possible for Mary to be Jesusʼ mother. Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to his followers at the Feast of Pentecost. The Holy Spirit is a Friend who makes Jesusʼ followers able to continue doing his work.\ef* made it possible for \k Mary\k*\ef -  \fr  1:18-25 \fk  Mary of Nazareth: \ft  A young woman from Nazareth who served God faithfully. She had promised to marry a man named Joseph. She became pregnant even though she hadnʼt had sex with a man. The power of the Holy Spirit made this possible. She was the human mother of Jesus the Messiah.\ef* to be pregnant. The \k angel\k*\ef -  \fr  1:18-25 \fk  Angel: \ft  A messenger sent by God to tell people Godʼs words or do work for God on earth. Angels are spiritual beings. They can look like humans but donʼt have bodies like human bodies.\ef* told \k Joseph\k*\ef -  \fr  1:18-25 \fk  Joseph: \ft  The husband of Mary of Nazareth. He was from the family line of David and served God faithfully. He was a carpenter skilled at working with wood, bricks and metal. He was not the father of Jesus but adopted Jesus as his son. He took care of Jesus and protected him while he was young.\ef* that this baby would be the \k Saviour\k*\ef -  \fr  1:18-25 \fk  Saviour: \ft  A name for Jesus as the Messiah. He saves Godʼs people and Godʼs world from sin and death.\ef* of \k Godʼs people\k*\ef -  \fr  1:18-25 \fk  Godʼs people: \ft  A way to talk about the nation of Israel. After Jesus came, anyone who follows him is considered part of Godʼs chosen people.\ef*. Words from the prophet \k Isaiah\k*\ef -  \fr  1:18-25 \fk  Isaiah: \ft  A prophet in the southern kingdom of Judah during the time of Hezekiah and other kings. Stories about him are in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. His prophecies are recorded in the book of Isaiah.\ef* came true in Jesusʼ life (\xt Matthew 1:23\xt*). They showed that God is with his people through Jesus. Jesus would bring the freedom and healing that God wanted to give them.

\c 2 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesusʼ birth, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem. 
\v 2 They asked, ‘Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose. Now we have come to worship him.’ 
\p 
\v 3 When King Herod heard about it, he was very upset. Everyone in Jerusalem was troubled too. 
\v 4 So Herod called together all the chief priests of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah was going to be born. 
\v 5 ‘In Bethlehem in Judea,’ they replied. ‘This is what the prophet has written. He said, 
\q1 
\v 6 ‘ “But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, 
\q2 are certainly not the least important among the towns of Judah. 
\q1 A ruler will come out of you. 
\q2 He will rule my people Israel like a shepherd.” ’ (\xt Micah 5:2\xt*) 
\p 
\v 7 Then Herod secretly called for the Wise Men. He found out from them exactly when the star had appeared. 
\v 8 He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, ‘Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report it to me. Then I can go and worship him too.’ 
\p 
\v 9 After the Wise Men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was. 
\v 10 When they saw the star, they were filled with joy. 
\v 11 The Wise Men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense and myrrh. 
\v 12 But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their country on a different road. 
\im  \bd  2:1-12\bd* Jesus was born into a poor family in a small town called \w  Bethlehem\w*. His birth wasnʼt important news that everyone knew about. But Matthew wrote about some signs that showed how important Jesusʼ birth was.

\ip  \w  Bethlehem\w* The town that King David was from and where Jesus was born. It is about 8 kilometres south of Jerusalem.

\p 
\v 13 When the Wise Men had left, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph. ‘Get up!’ the angel said. ‘Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to come back. Herod is going to search for the child. He wants to kill him.’ 
\p 
\v 14 So Joseph got up. During the night, he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary. 
\v 15 They stayed there until King Herod died. So the words the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true. He had said, ‘I brought my son out of Egypt.’ (\xt Hosea 11:1\xt*) 
\p 
\v 16 Herod realised that the Wise Men had tricked him. So he became very angry. He gave orders about Bethlehem and the area around it. He ordered all the boys two years old and under to be killed. This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star. 
\v 17 In this way, the words Jeremiah the prophet spoke came true. He had said, 
\q1 
\v 18 ‘A voice is heard in Ramah. 
\q2 Itʼs the sound of crying and deep sadness. 
\q1 Rachel is crying over her children. 
\q2 She refuses to be comforted, 
\q2 because they are gone.’ (\xt Jeremiah 31:15\xt*) 
\p 
\v 19 After Herod died, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him. 
\v 20 The angel said, ‘Get up! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. The people who were trying to kill the child are dead.’ 
\p 
\v 21 So Joseph got up. He took the child and his mother Mary back to the land of Israel. 
\v 22 But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus was ruling in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. Joseph had been warned in a dream. So he went back to the land of Galilee instead. 
\v 23 There he lived in a town called Nazareth. So what the prophets had said about Jesus came true. They had said that he would be called a Nazarene. 
\im  \bd  2:13-23\bd* \k  Herod\k*\ef -  \fr  2:13-23 \fk  Herod the Great: \ft  The King Herod of Matthew 2 and Luke 1. He was a ruler appointed by the Romans with the title King of the Jews. He ruled as king from around 36 BC to 4 BC. He ruled over Judea and all of Israelʼs lands. He was from the family line of Esau but was considered a Jew. He ordered many building projects, including the city of Caesarea. He made the temple in Jerusalem bigger and greater than it had ever been.\ef* was the king of \k Judea\k*\ef -  \fr  2:13-23 \fk  Judea: \ft  The southern area of the land of Israel. The tribe of Judah lived in Judea. Jerusalem was the most important city in Judea.\ef*. The emperor \k Caesar\k*\ef -  \fr  2:13-23 \fk  Caesar: \ft  The ruler with most authority in all lands controlled by the Roman government. Julius Caesar was the first to use this name. The rulers who came after him also used it. The Caesars after Julius were emperors of Rome. The Romans worshipped their emperor as the supreme lord and the son of the gods. The announcement that Jesus is Lord and Godʼs Son challenged the authority of Romeʼs ruler.\ef* had made him king. The \k Wise Men\k*\ef -  \fr  2:13-23 \fk  Wise Men: \ft  Important men from lands east of Israel. They studied the stars in the sky. After Jesus was born, they worshipped him as the true King of the world.\ef* had announced that Jesus was a king. Herod was very upset because a new king would challenge his power. Herod was a mean and unkind ruler who treated people badly. Since he could have people killed, it seemed like he had all the power. But God protected the baby Jesus from King Herod. His parents escaped to \k Egypt\k*\ef -  \fr  2:13-23 \fk  Egypt: \ft  A powerful nation in northern Africa. The Israelites were slaves there for many years. They were freed from slavery in Egypt in the exodus. Egypt was ruled by a Pharaoh. In the Bible, Egypt sometimes harmed Godʼs people and other times helped them.\ef* and later lived in safety in \k Galilee\k*\ef -  \fr  2:13-23 \fk  Galilee: \ft  The northern area of the land of Israel. It was ruled by Herod Antipas in Jesusʼ time. Jesus grew up in Galilee. Much of his teaching and healing was done in Galilee.\ef*. Jesus would be a different kind of King than Herod. Instead of violence, he would rule with the power of love.

\p 
\v 1 In those days John the Baptist came and preached in the Desert of Judea. 
\v 2 He said, ‘Turn away from your sins! The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ 
\v 3 John is the one Isaiah the prophet had spoken about. He had said, 
\q1 ‘A messenger is calling out in the desert, 
\q1 “Prepare the way for the Lord. 
\q2 Make straight paths for him.” ’ (\xt Isaiah 40:3\xt*) 
\p 
\v 4 Johnʼs clothes were made out of camelʼs hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 
\v 5 People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea. They also came from the whole area around the River Jordan. 
\v 6 When they confessed their sins, John baptised them in the Jordan. 
\p 
\v 7 John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptising. He said to them, ‘You are like a nest of poisonous snakes! Who warned you to escape the coming of Godʼs anger? 
\v 8 Live in a way that shows you have turned away from your sins. 
\v 9 Donʼt think you can say to yourselves, “Abraham is our father.” I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones. 
\v 10 The axe is ready to cut the roots of the trees. All the trees that donʼt produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire. 
\p 
\v 11 ‘I baptise you with water, calling you to turn away from your sins. But after me, someone is coming who is more powerful than I am. Iʼm not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
\v 12 His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing-floor. He will gather his wheat into the storeroom. But he will burn the husks with fire that canʼt be put out.’ 
\im \bd 3:1-12\bd* \k John the Baptist\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  John the Baptist: \ft  One of Jesusʼ relatives. The angel Gabriel announced his birth. His parents were Elizabeth and Zechariah. He lived in the desert and ate locusts and honey. John the Baptist preached to Jews about turning away from sin. He baptised people and helped them prepare for the coming of Jesus. King Herod Antipas had him put to death by cutting off his head.\ef* was the messenger who came before the Messiah. In many ways he was like the \k prophets\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  Prophet: \ft  A person God chooses to speak through. Prophets take a message from God to their people or to other nations.\ef* from long ago. His wore clothing like the prophet \k Elijahʼs\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  Elijah: \ft  A powerful prophet in the northern kingdom of Israel when Ahab was king. God did mighty works through him. Stories about him are in 1 and 2 Kings. He didnʼt die but was taken up to heaven by a strong wind.\ef* (\xt 2 Kings 1:8\xt*). His message was also like Elijahʼs message. He told people how to get ready for the \k Lord\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  Lord: \ft  The word for master in the Greek language. It was used to show respect for men who had authority. The word lord was used for the Roman emperor. It meant he had authority over everything and everyone. Jesus is called Lord in a special way. His followers called him Lord. This showed that he had the highest authority over everything and everyone. By calling Jesus Lord they challenged the authority of Caesar.\ef* to come. Also like Elijah, he went out into the desert and then to the \k River Jordan\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  River Jordan: \ft  The biggest river in the land of Israel. Itʼs about 250 kilometres long. It flows north to south from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea.\ef*. One person after another turned away from \k sin\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  Sin: \ft  Harmful thoughts, actions or desires that are against what God wants. These can be harmful to people themselves, to others and to Godʼs world. The Bible describes sin as a master and humans are its slaves. Sin is evil. Jesus is the only one powerful enough to destroy sin and free humans from its power.\ef* and was \k baptised\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  Baptism: \ft  A practice among Jews. Through baptism, people showed with their bodies something that had happened inside of them. People would go into the water and be covered by it. Then they would come back out of the water. People did this to be made clean according to Jewish laws. Gentiles were baptised to show they had accepted the Jewish faith. Jews were baptised to show they had turned away from sin and were obeying God. Christians are baptised to show they have turned away from sin and believe in Jesus. It shows they are committed to following Jesus and being part of Godʼs people.\ef* because of Johnʼs preaching. Yet John the Baptistʼs work wasnʼt just about each individual person. He was preparing the community for Godʼs arrival. He expected the Messiah to come and \k judge\k*\ef -  \fr  3:1-12 \fk  Judge: \ft  Jesus is the Judge of the world. He will show if peopleʼs thoughts and actions are based on trusting him. He will show what is good and what is evil. (See \w  judgement day\w* \xt Matthew 19:16-30\xt*.)\ef* them.

\p 
\v 13 Jesus came from Galilee to the River Jordan. He wanted to be baptised by John. 
\v 14 But John tried to stop him. So he told Jesus, ‘I need to be baptised by you. So why do you come to me?’ 
\p 
\v 15 Jesus replied, ‘Let it be this way for now. It is right for us to do this. It carries out Godʼs holy plan.’ Then John agreed. 
\p 
\v 16 As soon as Jesus was baptised, he came up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove. 
\v 17 A voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him.’ 
\im  \bd  3:13-17\bd* Jesus hadnʼt sinned, so John the Baptist didnʼt expect to baptise him. But Jesus was showing that he really was one of the people of Israel. At Jesusʼ baptism, God made himself known as the \k Father\k*\ef -  \fr  3:13-17 \fk  Father: \ft  One name for God. The Father is God just like Jesus is God and the Holy Spirit is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. God showed himself to be Israelʼs Father during the exodus and called Israel his son. Later, God showed himself to be the Father of Jesus. Jesus shows that God is the Father of all who are part of Godʼs family.\ef*, the Son and the Holy Spirit. These are the three persons of the \k Trinity\k*\ef -  \fr  3:13-17 \fk  Trinity: \ft  There is only one real and true God. The one and only God is three persons. This is the Trinity. The three persons are God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\ef*. The Spirit of God came down as a dove. This was a sign of the peace that the Messiah was offering. Then the Father announced the truth about Jesus. Jesus is \k Godʼs Son\k*\ef -  \fr  3:13-17 \fk  Godʼs Son or Son of God: \ft  A name used for Israelʼs kings in the Old Testament. It showed how they were chosen by God to rule and were worthy of honour. In New Testament times, Roman emperors were called son of god. It showed that they believed the Roman gods gave Caesar his power. The name was used in a special way to talk about Jesus. It means that the one, true, mighty God is Jesusʼ Father. Using this name for Jesus made Jews who didnʼt accept him very angry. It also made the Roman government angry because it challenged Caesarʼs authority.\ef*, and God loves him. These signs helped Jesus get ready to do his special work for God and others.

\v 1 The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There the devil tempted him. 
\v 2 After 40 days and 40 nights of going without eating, Jesus was hungry. 
\v 3 The tempter came to him. He said, ‘If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.’ 
\p 
\v 4 Jesus answered, ‘It is written, “Man must not live only on bread. He must also live on every word that comes from the mouth of God.” ’ (\xt Deuteronomy 8:3\xt*) 
\p 
\v 5 Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 
\v 6 ‘If you are the Son of God,’ he said, ‘throw yourself down. It is written, 
\q1 ‘ “The Lord will command his angels to take good care of you. 
\q2 They will lift you up in their hands. 
\q2 Then you wonʼt trip over a stone.” ’ (\xt Psalm 91:11,12\xt*) 
\p 
\v 7 Jesus answered him, ‘It is also written, “Do not test the Lord your God.” ’ (\xt Deuteronomy 6:16\xt*) 
\p 
\v 8 Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 
\v 9 ‘If you bow down and worship me,’ he said, ‘I will give you all this.’ 
\p 
\v 10 Jesus said to him, ‘Get away from me, Satan! It is written, “Worship the Lord your God. He is the only one you should serve.” ’ (\xt Deuteronomy 6:13\xt*) 
\p 
\v 11 Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him. 
\im  \bd  4:1-11\bd* In the desert, Jesus prepared to begin his special work in public. Right away the \k devil\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Devil: \ft  An angel who stopped serving God. He is the leader of all spiritual powers. He opposes Godʼs work and Godʼs people. He is called the devil, the prince of this world, the prince of demons and Satan. He tells lies and accuses Godʼs people of doing wrong. He tries to make them be unfaithful to God. (See \w  demons\w* \xt Matthew 4:18-25\xt*. \w  Evil spirits\w* \xt Matthew 17:14-27\xt*.)\ef* came to tempt him. The devil wanted to keep ruling the \k world\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  World: \ft  The place that God made for humans and all creation to live. God will one day make it new again. New Testament writers also used the word world when talking about evil. People can choose to follow the evil ways of the world. Or they can choose to serve Godʼs kingdom and follow Godʼs ways.\ef* and doing evil. His power was in danger because Jesus the true King had come.

\ip  The devil urged Jesus to find help and strength in something other than God. He wanted Jesus to turn stones into bread. If Jesus did that, he would be providing for his own needs instead of trusting God. He wanted Jesus to jump down from the \k temple\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Temple: \ft  The building that was used as a place to worship God and to meet with him. God told King David how it should be built. King Solomon built the first one. The Babylonians destroyed it. Many years later, the Jews built another one. Jesus called the temple his Fatherʼs house. After the Romans destroyed it in the year AD 70, the Jews never built another temple.\ef* to show how powerful he was. If Jesus did that he would be proudly seeking glory for himself. He wouldnʼt be trusting God to honour him. Then the devil offered to give Jesus all the riches of the world. If Jesus worshipped the devil he couldnʼt serve and worship God.

\ip  Each time, Jesus answered the devil using words from the book of Deuteronomy. In Deuteronomy \k Moses\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Moses: \ft  A Hebrew or Jewish slave who grew up in the royal palace in Egypt. God appeared to him in the desert and gave him special work. Moses led Godʼs people out of slavery, through the desert and to their new land. God gave instructions to Moses as to how his people should live. These instructions are recorded in the first five books of the Old Testament. These instructions are called the law or the Law of Moses (\xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*).\ef* had urged Godʼs people to be faithful to Godʼs \k covenant\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Covenant: \ft  An agreement or set of promises. In the Bible, itʼs usually between God and his people. Covenants were also made between people. Making a covenant showed that they promised to do what they had agreed to do. (See \w  Old covenant\w* \xt Romans 9:19-33\xt*. \w  New covenant\w* \xt 1 Corinthians 11:17-34\xt*.)\ef* with them. Israel didnʼt listen to Moses. Unlike them, Jesus did remain \k faithful\k*\ef -  \fr  4:1-11 \fk  Faith or faithful: \ft  There are several meanings for faith in the Bible. The first meaning is the things people believe about God. God wants all people to believe what is true about him. These are things God has shown about himself and ways he has acted. In the New Testament, these things include the message of good news about Jesus. The second meaning of faith is the belief itself. This is the trust that people have in God. It is based on their hope of how God will keep his promises. How strong peopleʼs faith is shows much they trust God. Their faith grows as they know God more and more. The third meaning of faith is how people live based on what they believe. Godʼs people are to follow Godʼs ways for living. Jesus showed people how to do this. Faith in Jesus includes following his example for living.\ef* to God. The devil left Jesus, but he kept trying to stop Jesusʼ work.

\p 
\v 12 John had been put in prison. When Jesus heard about this, he returned to Galilee. 
\v 13 Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the city of Capernaum. It was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
\v 14 In that way, what the prophet Isaiah had said came true. He had said, 
\q1 
\v 15 ‘Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! 
\q2 Galilee, where Gentiles live! 
\q2 Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Territory east of the River Jordan! 
\q1 
\v 16 The people who are now living in darkness 
\q2 have seen a great light. 
\q1 They are now living in a very dark land. 
\q2 But a light has shone on them.’ (\xt Isaiah 9:1,2\xt*) 
\p 
\v 17 From that time on Jesus began to preach. ‘Turn away from your sins!’ he said. ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ 
\im  \bd  4:12-17\bd* Long ago through Israelʼs prophets God promised that he would give his people a new ruler. This ruler would come through Davidʼs family line (\xt Isaiah 9:7\xt*). Matthew showed that Jesus was that ruler. He was from Galilee which was the place Isaiah had prophesied about. And he brought Godʼs light. The prophet Isaiah talked about living in \k darkness.\k*\ef -  \fr  4:12-17 \fk  Darkness: \ft  Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word darkness. The first meaning is when the sun sets, and itʼs dark outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that are opposed to God. This darkness causes confusion and problems. It wants to destroy what God has made. Evil powers are often spoken about as the kingdom of darkness.\ef* This was a way of describing what sin does to people. It controls them so they canʼt see who God is or enjoy his goodness. But Matthew said that great \k light\k*\ef -  \fr  4:12-17 \fk  Light: \ft  Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word light. The first meaning is when the sun is shining and there is light outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that agree with God. Light includes things that show or do what God wants for his world. It includes peace, understanding, health, and goodness. Godʼs light works to free Godʼs world from evil powers that are described as darkness. The time when God rules as King is talked about as the kingdom of light.\ef* was shining on people. Jesus was the light that showed people what God is like. He showed them what it meant to live for God. They started by turning away from sin. Through Jesus, God was bringing his rule to earth. 
\p 
\v 18 One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake, because they were fishermen. 
\v 19 ‘Come and follow me,’ Jesus said. ‘I will send you out to fish for people.’ 
\v 20 At once they left their nets and followed him. 
\p 
\v 21 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers. They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee. As they were preparing their nets, Jesus called out to them. 
\v 22 Right away they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. 
\p 
\v 23 Jesus went all over Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues. He preached the good news of Godʼs kingdom. He healed every illness and disease the people had. 
\v 24 News about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were suffering different kinds of illnesses. Some were suffering great pain. Others were controlled by demons. Some were shaking wildly. Others couldnʼt move at all. And Jesus healed all of them. 
\v 25 Large crowds followed him. People came from Galilee, from the area known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the area across the River Jordan. 
\im  \bd  4:18-25\bd* Jesus had special work to do for \k Godʼs kingdom\k*\ef -  \fr  4:18-25 \fk  Godʼs kingdom or Kingdom of God: \ft  Godʼs rule as King on earth. Jesus announced the message about Godʼs kingdom. He taught about it through parables. It comes to earth in a slow process. It started through Jesusʼ work. It keeps spreading as the church continues to be faithful to Jesus. (See \w  Heaven\w* \xt Matthew 6:16-34\xt*.)\ef*. He began this work by asking certain people to be his \k disciples\k*\ef -  \fr  4:18-25 \fk  Disciple: \ft  Someone who follows a teacher or a leader. Disciples do what their teacher does and lives like them. While he worked in Israel, Jesus chose certain disciples to be his closest followers. There were 12 of them just like there were 12 tribes in the nation of Israel. The 12 disciples are also called apostles.\ef*. They would join Jesus in his work and learn from him. They saw that he had authority. They left their daily work and followed him at once.

\ip  Jesusʼ work included teaching and healing. He taught that God is the true King of the world. In Jesus, God had come to save people from sin, death and all evil. This was \k good news\k*\ef -  \fr  4:18-25 \fk  Good news: \ft  The message about Jesus. In the Greek language the entire message is called the gospel. (See \w  gospel\w* \xt Matthew 7:24-29\xt*.) Itʼs the message that God rescues people from sin and death. This means that people can fully worship their Creator and live in relationship with him again. This can happen because Jesus gave his life to save all human beings. He died as a sacrifice to free people from being slaves to evil. Then God raised him from the dead. Jesus is the Jewish Messiah that God had promised to send. He brings Godʼs eternal life and the power of resurrection to all who trust him.\ef*! Jesus acted with power to make many people strong and healthy. He was showing that God is stronger than illness, pain and \k demons.\k*\ef -  \fr  4:18-25 \fk  Demons: \ft  Spirits that God created but who turned against him. They work against God. Their power comes from Satan. They can use their power to control people and be inside them. When humans serve demons instead of God, they become slaves to sin and death. Jesus drove out demons from many people. Demons canʼt be inside of or control people who believe in Jesus and follow him. The Holy Spirit protects Godʼs people from demons. He gives them power to drive out demons like Jesus did. (See \w  devil\w* \xt Matthew 4:1-11\xt*. \w  Evil spirits\w* \xt Matthew 17:14-27\xt*.)\ef* People heard about these mighty works and were excited. Large crowds gathered around Jesus.

\c 5 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him. 
\v 2 Then he began to teach them. 
\p He said, 
\q1 
\v 3 ‘Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. 
\q2 The kingdom of heaven belongs to them. 
\q1 
\v 4 Blessed are those who are sad. 
\q2 They will be comforted. 
\q1 
\v 5 Blessed are those who are humble. 
\q2 They will be given the earth. 
\q1 
\v 6 Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right. 
\q2 They will be filled. 
\q1 
\v 7 Blessed are those who show mercy. 
\q2 They will be shown mercy. 
\q1 
\v 8 Blessed are those whose hearts are pure. 
\q2 They will see God. 
\q1 
\v 9 Blessed are those who make peace. 
\q2 They will be called children of God. 
\q1 
\v 10 Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right. 
\q2 The kingdom of heaven belongs to them. 
\p 
\v 11 ‘Blessed are you when people make fun of you and hurt you because of me. You are also blessed when they tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me. 
\v 12 Be joyful and glad. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people hurt the prophets who lived long ago. 
\im  \bd  5:1-12\bd* This was the first of Jesusʼ long messages. The message began with Jesus gathering his disciples together on a mountainside. It ended when \it  Jesus finished saying all these things\it* (\xt Matthew 7:28\xt*). In it, Jesus taught his disciples how to live as part of the kingdom of heaven. 
\ip  He started by saying what kind of people would be part of the kingdom of heaven. This kingdom is very different from how human kingdoms or governments work. It isnʼt for people who are proud and think they donʼt need God. It isnʼt for people who use their strength to make others suffer. It isnʼt for people who are only committed to their own happiness. Jesus knows that many people have been treated badly and are suffering. Many are sad and know they need help. Many people are longing for justice and peace to fill the earth. Many understand what God cares deeply about and do it even when itʼs hard. Jesus said all of these people are blessed. They are Godʼs children. He will comfort them and show them mercy. They are part of the kingdom of heaven. 
\p 
\v 13 ‘You are the salt of the earth. But suppose the salt loses its saltiness. How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk all over it. 
\p 
\v 14 ‘You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill canʼt be hidden. 
\v 15 Also, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand. Then it gives light to everyone in the house. 
\v 16 In the same way, let your light shine so others can see it. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will bring glory to your Father who is in heaven. 
\p 
\v 17 ‘Do not think I have come to get rid of what is written in the Law or in the Prophets. I have not come to do this. Instead, I have come to fulfil what is written. 
\v 18 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter disappears from the Law. Not even the smallest mark of a pen will disappear from the Law until everything is completed. 
\v 19 Do not ignore even one of the least important commands. And do not teach others to ignore them. If you do, you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practise and teach these commands. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven. 
\v 20 Here is what I tell you. You must be more godly than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. 
\im  \bd  5:13-20\bd* Jesus said that Godʼs people are to be salt and light in the world. He was talking about the way that they live. Salt keeps food from rotting, and light makes darkness go away. God doesnʼt want his world to rot away or be in darkness because of sin. His people must live in ways that keep his world healthy and safe. Thatʼs how they help other peoples and nations come to know and serve God.

\ip  Jesus loved the \k Scriptures\k*\ef -  \fr  5:13-20 \fk  Scripture: \ft  In Jesusʼ time, the holy writings of the people of Israel. Itʼs also called the Old Testament. (See \w  Godʼs word\w* \xt Matthew 15:1-20\xt*. \w  Bible\w* \xt John 1:1-18\xt*.)\ef* that God had given to his people. He taught people to respect and follow Godʼs instructions from many years before. The \k Law\k*\ef -  \fr  5:13-20 \fk  Law or Law of Moses: \ft  Godʼs instructions for his people about how to live and share his life with others. God gave these instructions to Moses. Some of the laws are about worshipping God in proper ways. Other laws are about how people should treat one another. Other laws deal with how they should live together in communities and as a nation. The Ten Commandments were the first laws God gave Moses. All the laws are recorded in the first five books of the Old Testament. All together, these five books are called the Law or Law of Moses. They tell about the beginning of the world and of the people of Israel. (See \w  Moses\w* \xt Matthew 4:1-11\xt*. \w  Jewish laws\w* \xt Matthew 26:57-68\xt*).\ef* and the \k Prophets\k*\ef -  \fr  5:13-20 \fk  Prophets: \ft  Many of the prophets God sent to Israel wrote down their messages. These writings are in the Old Testament and are called the Prophets.\ef* were part of Godʼs plan to save the world. Jesusʼ life was the next part of Godʼs plan. Jesus was bringing the kingdom of heaven that the Law and the Prophets had always pointed to.

\p 
\v 21 ‘You have heard what was said to people who lived long ago. They were told, “Do not commit murder. (\xt Exodus 20:13\xt*) Anyone who murders will be judged for it.” 
\v 22 But here is what I tell you. Do not be angry with a brother or sister. Anyone who is angry with them will be judged. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, “Raca”, must stand trial in court. And anyone who says, “You fool!” will be in danger of the fire in hell. 
\p 
\v 23 ‘Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar. And you remember that your brother or sister has something against you. 
\v 24 Leave your gift in front of the altar. First go and make peace with them. Then come back and offer your gift. 
\p 
\v 25 ‘Suppose someone has a claim against you and is taking you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do this while you are still together on the way. If you donʼt, you may be handed over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer to be thrown into prison. 
\v 26 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. You will not get out until you have paid the very last penny! 
\p 
\v 27 ‘You have heard that it was said, “Do not commit adultery.” (\xt Exodus 20:14\xt*) 
\v 28 But here is what I tell you. Do not even look at a woman in the wrong way. Anyone who does has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
\v 29 If your right eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. Your eye is only one part of your body. It is better to lose an eye than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 
\v 30 If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose a hand than for your whole body to go into hell. 
\p 
\v 31 ‘It has been said, “Suppose a man divorces his wife. If he does, he must give her a letter of divorce.” (\xt Deuteronomy 24:1\xt*) 
\v 32 But here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife makes her a victim of adultery. And anyone who gets married to the divorced woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him. 
\p 
\v 33 ‘Again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, “Do not break the promises you make to the Lord. Keep your promises to the Lord that you have made.” 
\v 34 But here is what I tell you. Do not make any promises like that at all. Do not make them in the name of heaven. That is Godʼs throne. 
\v 35 Do not make them in the name of the earth. That is the stool for Godʼs feet. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the Great King. 
\v 36 And do not make a promise in your own name. You canʼt make even one hair of your head white or black. 
\v 37 All you need to say is simply “Yes” or “No”. Anything more than this comes from the evil one. 
\p 
\v 38 ‘You have heard that it was said, “An eye must be put out for an eye. A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth.” (\xt Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21\xt*) 
\v 39 But here is what I tell you. Do not fight against an evil person. Suppose someone slaps you on your right cheek. Turn your other cheek to them also. 
\v 40 Suppose someone takes you to court to get your shirt. Let them have your coat also. 
\v 41 Suppose someone forces you to go one mile. Go 2 miles with them. 
\v 42 Give to the one who asks you for something. Donʼt turn away from the one who wants to borrow something from you. 
\p 
\v 43 ‘You have heard that it was said, “Love your neighbour. (\xt Leviticus 19:18\xt*) Hate your enemy.” 
\v 44 But here is what I tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you. 
\v 45 Then you will be children of your Father who is in heaven. He causes his sun to shine on evil people and good people. He sends rain on those who do right and those who donʼt. 
\v 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that. 
\v 47 If you greet only your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even people who are ungodly do that. 
\v 48 So be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. 
\im  \bd  5:21-48\bd* Jesus taught about many laws recorded in the Law of Moses. The exact words of the laws arenʼt what is most important. God is looking for people who understand what he really desires. Jesus gave many examples of what God wants. Every example was about how people live with others and treat one another. Jesus taught that people should love their enemies and not just their friends and \k neighbours\k*\ef -  \fr  5:21-48 \fk  Neighbour: \ft  Throughout the Bible, neighbour is a way of talking about other people. Godʼs people understood that all other Israelites were their neighbours. They treated them better than they treated outsiders. (See \w  outsiders\w* \xt Matthew 1:1-17\xt*.) In the New Testament, Jesus taught that all humans are neighbours to one another. All people are to be treated with love and respect.\ef*. People shouldnʼt treat others based on how they themselves have been treated. Instead, Jesus taught people to look for ways to do good for others. The children of the kingdom of heaven take care of others and bless them.

Certain places were holy because people knew God was there. God himself is holy. This means he is completely different from everything else that exists. The opposite of holy is evil, and it canʼt be in Godʼs presence. Godʼs people must live in ways that show they have been set free from sin and death. This is how they can be holy.\ef* and \k holy living\k*\ef -  \fr  6:1-15 \fk  Holy living or godly living: \ft  Following Jesusʼ example for how to think, speak and act. This is how believers can be holy like God is holy. The Holy Spirit makes it possible for believers to live in holy ways. Godly ways of living show that believers have been set free from sin and death.\ef* means. He taught that God should be at the centre of peopleʼs thoughts and actions. God sees when his children do good deeds. The reason they do good isnʼt so that they can be honoured by others. They do good because they want to share the wonderful things their Father provides.

\ip  Jesus gave an example of God being at the centre of peopleʼs thoughts and actions. He taught his disciples how to \k pray\k*\ef -  \fr  6:1-15 \fk  Prayer: \ft  The practice of talking with God and listening to God.\ef*. Earlier he had talked about people who were blessed in the kingdom of heaven (\xt Matthew 5:3-12\xt*). This prayer was an example of what those blessed people pray.

\ip  Jesusʼ prayer recognised that those who follow God are part of his family. Godʼs children call him Father. They are humble and seek to honour him instead of themselves. They trust that God is the King. They long for when he will destroy evil and fully rule on earth. They depend on him for food and all that they need. They trust him to have mercy and forgive them. They show this mercy to others, make peace and forgive others. Earlier, Jesus was faithful to God when the devil tempted him. God will help his children stay faithful and say no to sin when they are tempted. They trust God to save them from the devil and all who do evil.

\v 16 ‘When you go without eating, do not look gloomy like those who only pretend to be holy. They make their faces look very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What Iʼm about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward. 
\v 17 But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face. 
\v 18 Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who canʼt be seen, will know it. Your Father will reward you, because he sees what you do secretly. 
\p 
\v 19 ‘Do not gather for yourselves riches on earth. Moths and rats can destroy them. Thieves can break in and steal them. 
\v 20 Instead, gather for yourselves riches in heaven. There, moths and rats do not destroy them. There, thieves do not break in and steal them. 
\v 21 Your heart will be where your riches are.

\v 22 ‘The eye is like a lamp for the body. Suppose your eyes are healthy. Then your whole body will be full of light.

\p 
\v 24 ‘No one can serve two masters at the same time. You will hate one of them and love the other. Or you will be faithful to one and dislike the other. You canʼt serve God and money at the same time. 
\p 
\v 25 ‘I tell you, do not worry. Donʼt worry about your life and what you will eat or drink. And donʼt worry about your body and what you will wear. Isnʼt there more to life than eating? Arenʼt there more important things for the body than clothes? 
\v 26 Look at the birds of the air. They donʼt plant or gather crops. They donʼt put away crops in storerooms. But your Father who is in heaven feeds them. Arenʼt you worth much more than they are? 
\v 27 Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying? 
\p 
\v 28 ‘And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They donʼt work or make clothing. 
\v 29 But here is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all his royal robes was dressed like one of these flowers. 
\v 30 If that is how God dresses the wild grass, wonʼt he dress you even better? Your faith is so small! After all, the grass is here only today. Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. 
\v 31 So donʼt worry. Donʼt say, “What will we eat?” Or, “What will we drink?” Or, “What will we wear?” 
\v 32 People who are ungodly run after all those things. Your Father who is in heaven knows that you need them. 
\v 33 But put Godʼs kingdom first. Do what he wants you to do. Then all those things will also be given to you. 
\v 34 So donʼt worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. 
\im  \bd  6:16-34\bd* Jesus taught more about how God must be at the centre of peopleʼs thoughts and actions. People care about things in the proper way only when they trust and love God. If money and other treasures are at the centre, people serve them like \k gods\k*\ef -  \fr  6:16-34 \fk  False gods or gods: \ft  Anything that people worship that is more important to them than the true God. People worship things because they believe they have power. Satan uses their worship of these things to trap people and control them. The people groups in the Bible also made pictures or statues of some of these things. But the pictures or statues are objects that have no power.\ef*. This turns them away from the true God who created them. Worry shouldnʼt control Godʼs children. The Father in \k heaven\k*\ef -  \fr  6:16-34 \fk  Heaven: \ft  Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word heaven. The first meaning is the sky above the earth. The second meaning is where God the King and Creator rules and is worshipped. Heaven isnʼt a place that humans can travel to like places on earth. People canʼt fully understand or imagine heaven. (See \w  Kingdom of God\w* \xt Matthew 4:18-25\xt*.)\ef* knows and loves them. The Creator takes care of all living things and of humans in a special way. So Godʼs children must trust him. They must do what their Father wants done in his kingdom.

\v 12 In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and in the Prophets. 
\im  \bd  7:1-12\bd* Jesus wanted his people to live holy lives full of love. He said in a few words what the entire Old Testament teaches. People must treat others the way they want to be treated. When they do, they are part of Godʼs kingdom coming on earth. They are part of the new community of people who believe Jesus is the King. But some people think that Godʼs instructions for living give them authority to judge others. This isnʼt what God wants. His children must be humble, wise and full of mercy. God has good gifts to give and longs for all people to ask for them. He wants all people to search for his kingdom and be part of his family.

\v 16 You can tell each tree by its fruit. Do people pick grapes from bushes? Do they pick figs from thorns? 
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit. But a bad tree bears bad fruit. 
\v 18 A good tree canʼt bear bad fruit. And a bad tree canʼt bear good fruit. 
\v 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down. It is thrown into the fire.

\v 21 ‘Not everyone who says to me, “Lord, Lord,” will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants will enter. 
\v 22 Many will say to me on that day, “Lord! Lord! Didnʼt we prophesy in your name? Didnʼt we drive out demons in your name? Didnʼt we do many miracles in your name?” 
\v 23 Then I will tell them clearly, “I never knew you. Get away from me, you who do evil!” 
\im  \bd  7:13-23\bd* Jesus was still teaching on the mountainside. He talked about the important choice that all people face. Every person must decide between two ways of living. They can choose the way of \k eternal life\k*\ef -  \fr  7:13-23 \fk  Eternal life: \ft  This is life in the world to come that canʼt be destroyed by sin or death. It is life when God has won the battle over evil once and for all. It is life when God has returned to his people and made all things new. It is life when God rules completely as King over everything and everyone. This life of peace and friendship with God will last for ever.\ef* with God. People who want eternal life with God do what their Father wants. They are part of the kingdom of heaven. They are like healthy trees that bear good fruit. The other way of living is to refuse Godʼs life. That way destroys people. Some people pretend to follow Godʼs ways. They say or do things that make them seem like they are Godʼs children. But they are like trees that bear bad fruit. Because they are doing evil, so they arenʼt part of the kingdom of heaven.

\v 24 ‘So then, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man. He builds his house on the rock. 
\v 25 The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock. 
\v 26 But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man. He builds his house on sand. 
\v 27 The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. And it falls with a loud crash.’ 
\b 
\p 
\v 28 Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching. 
\v 29 Thatʼs because he taught like one who had authority. He did not speak like their teachers of the law. 
\im  \bd  7:24-29\bd* Jesus was finishing his long message on the mountainside. He told a story to show how important his teachings are. People who hear Jesusʼ words and obey them are like wise builders. Those who donʼt listen to Jesus or obey him are foolish. Jesus was also teaching his disciples something about the temple. The house he talked about in the story was the temple in \k Jerusalem\k*\ef -  \fr  7:24-29 \fk  Jerusalem: \ft  The capital city of the Jews who lived in the area of Judea. King David built it and King Solomon built Godʼs temple there. It was the centre of Jewish government and the worship of God.\ef*. It was called Godʼs house and it was built on the rock of \k Mount Zion\k*\ef -  \fr  7:24-29 \fk  Mount Zion: \ft  The hill the temple was built on in Jerusalem. Zion was also a way to talk about the city of Jerusalem. On Mount Zion God was present with his people in the temple. Jews described it as the place where God ruled as Lord over the whole world. God has promised to return to Mount Zion.\ef*. Jesus was showing them that now God was building a new house for himself. Jesusʼ words were like the rock God built his new house on. Godʼs new home would be in the lives of those who obey Jesusʼ words.

\ip  The first of Jesusʼ long messages in Matthewʼs \k gospel\k*\ef -  \fr  7:24-29 \fk  Gospel: \ft  A word from the Greek language that means good news. Itʼs also a name for books in the Bible about Jesus Christʼs life and work. The four gospels in the New Testament are Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The gospels tell the good news about Jesus. The writers based the gospels on records and stories from witnesses. The witnesses had lived and worked with Jesus. (See \w  good news\w* \xt Matthew 4:18-25\xt*.)\ef* ends here. Jesus wasnʼt like other \k rabbis\k*\ef -  \fr  7:24-29 \fk  Rabbi: \ft  A male Jewish teacher. Rabbis usually studied the Scriptures in schools and were trained by other rabbis. People who wanted to learn from them and be like them would become their disciples. The disciples or students were usually only boys and men. Jesus was a rabbi even though he wasnʼt trained like rabbis of that time. Unlike other rabbis, Jesus welcomed both women and men as his students.\ef* who only taught what they had learnt from Moses. He brought new teaching from God with great power and authority.

\p 
\v 1 Jesus came down from the mountainside. Large crowds followed him. 
\v 2 A man who had a skin disease came and got down on his knees in front of Jesus. He said, ‘Lord, if you are willing to make me “clean”, you can do it.’ 
\p 
\v 3 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. ‘I am willing to do it,’ he said. ‘Be “clean”!’ Right away the man was healed of his skin disease. 
\v 4 Then Jesus said to him, ‘Donʼt tell anyone. Go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift Moses commanded. It will be a witness to everyone.’ 
\p 
\v 5 When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman commander came to him. He asked Jesus for help. 
\v 6 ‘Lord’, he said, ‘my servant lies at home and canʼt move. He is suffering terribly.’ 
\p 
\v 7 Jesus said, ‘Shall I come and heal him?’ 
\p 
\v 8 The commander replied, ‘Lord, I am not good enough to have you come into my house. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
\v 9 I myself am a man under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, “Go”, and he goes. I tell that one, “Come”, and he comes. I say to my slave, “Do this”, and he does it.’ 
\p 
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those following him, ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. In Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong. 
\v 11 I say to you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
\v 12 But those who think they belong in the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness. There they will weep and grind their teeth.’ 
\p 
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the Roman commander, ‘Go! It will be done just as you believed it would.’ And his servant was healed at that moment. 
\p 
\v 14 When Jesus came into Peterʼs house, he saw Peterʼs mother-in-law. She was lying in bed. She had a fever. 
\v 15 Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him. 
\p 
\v 16 When evening came, many people controlled by demons were brought to Jesus. He drove out the spirits with a word. He healed all who were ill. 
\v 17 This happened so that what Isaiah the prophet had said would come true. He had said, 
\q1 ‘He suffered the things we should have suffered. 
\q2 He took on himself the diseases that should have been ours.’ (\xt Isaiah 53:4\xt*) 
\im  \bd  8:1-17\bd* Jesus travelled around Galilee in northern Israel. Because Jesus was known for healing people, many who were ill came to him. Jesus had shown great authority when he taught on the mountainside. He also showed great authority when he healed people.

\ip  Jesus healed a man with a skin disease and a Roman commanderʼs servant. He also healed \k Peter\k*\ef -  \fr  8:1-17 \fk  Peter or Simon Peter: \ft  A fisherman from Capernaum who became one of Jesusʼ 12 disciples. He was one of Jesusʼ three closest followers. He is also called Simon or Simon Peter.\ef*ʼs mother-in-law and people who were controlled by demons. Matthew was showing that Jesus is more powerful than illness and demons. But Godʼs kingdom only comes because Jesus was willing to suffer for people. Matthew used words from the prophet Isaiah to show that Jesus is Godʼs \k servant who suffers\k*\ef -  \fr  8:1-17 \fk  Servant who suffers or servant of God: \ft  The one that God had promised to send to save Godʼs people. Isaiah 53 says that he would obey God and be a servant of God. He would suffer as he served Godʼs people. In Acts 3, Peter shows how this servant who suffered was the Jewish Messiah. Peter also shows how Jesus is this Servant and Messiah.\ef*.

\p 
\v 18 Jesus saw the crowd around him. So he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. 
\v 19 Then a teacher of the law came to him. He said, ‘Teacher, I will follow you no matter where you go.’ 
\p 
\v 20 Jesus replied, ‘Foxes have dens. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.’ 
\p 
\v 21 Another follower said to him, ‘Lord, first let me go and bury my father.’ 
\p 
\v 22 But Jesus told him, ‘Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead.’ 
\p 
\v 23 Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him. 
\v 24 Suddenly a terrible storm came up on the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. 
\v 25 The disciples went and woke him up. They said, ‘Lord! Save us! Weʼre going to drown!’ 
\p 
\v 26 He replied, ‘Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?’ Then Jesus got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop. It became completely calm. 
\p 
\v 27 The disciples were amazed. They asked, ‘What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!’ 
\p 
\v 28 Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the area of the Gadarenes. Two men controlled by demons met him. They came from the tombs. The men were so wild that no one could pass that way. 
\v 29 ‘Son of God, what do you want with us?’ they shouted. ‘Have you come here to punish us before the time for us to be judged?’ 
\p 
\v 30 Not very far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding. 
\v 31 The demons begged Jesus, ‘If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.’ 
\p 
\v 32 Jesus said to them, ‘Go!’ So the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank. They ran into the lake and drowned in the water. 
\v 33 Those who were tending the pigs ran off. They went into the town and reported all this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by demons. 
\v 34 Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their area. 
\im  \bd  8:18-34\bd* When people saw that Jesus had authority, some chose to follow him. Others made excuses not to follow him. \bd  Jesus explained that choosing to follow him is the most important decision someone can make. It can also be the hardest choice.\bd* Then Jesus got into a boat with his disciples. The disciples were afraid when a storm came, but Jesus calmed the winds and waves. The disciples were amazed that Jesus had authority over the storm. Jesusʼ power brought peace to the lake. On the other side of the lake, Jesus also brought peace to two men. He drove out the demons that controlled them. Even though the people in that town saw Jesusʼ authority over demons they asked him to leave.

\c 9 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus stepped into a boat. He went over to the other side of the lake and came to his own town. 
\v 2 Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he said to the man, ‘Donʼt lose hope, son. Your sins are forgiven.’ 
\p 
\v 3 Then some teachers of the law said to themselves, ‘This fellow is saying a very evil thing!’ 
\p 
\v 4 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, ‘Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts? 
\v 5 Is it easier to say, “Your sins are forgiven”? Or to say, “Get up and walk”? 
\v 6 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.’ So he spoke to the man who could not walk. ‘Get up’, he said. ‘Take your mat and go home.’ 
\v 7 The man got up and went home. 
\v 8 When the crowd saw this, they were filled with wonder. They praised God for giving that kind of authority to a human being. 
\p 
\v 9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew. He was sitting at the tax collectorʼs booth. ‘Follow me’, Jesus told him. Matthew got up and followed him. 
\p 
\v 10 Later Jesus was having dinner at Matthewʼs house. Many tax collectors and sinners came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples. 
\v 11 The Pharisees saw this. So they asked the disciples, ‘Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?’ 
\p 
\v 12 Jesus heard this. So he said, ‘Those who are healthy donʼt need a doctor. Ill people do. 
\v 13 Go and learn what this means, “I want mercy and not sacrifice.” (\xt Hosea 6:6\xt*) I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me. I have come to get sinners to follow me.’ 
\p 
\v 14 One day Johnʼs disciples came. They said to Jesus, ‘We and the Pharisees often go without eating. Why donʼt your disciples go without eating?’ 
\p 
\v 15 Jesus answered, ‘How can the guests of the groom be sad while he is with them? The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast. 
\p 
\v 16 ‘People donʼt sew a patch of new cloth on old clothes. The new piece will pull away from the old. That will make the tear worse. 
\v 17 People donʼt pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, people pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are saved.’ 
\im  \bd  9:1-17\bd* A man who couldnʼt walk had friends who believed that Jesus came from God. They brought their friend to Jesus. Jesusʼ work was to bring Godʼs kingdom to the world. In Godʼs kingdom, sin doesnʼt control people. So Jesus forgave the manʼs sins. The \k teachers of the law\k*\ef -  \fr  9:1-17 \fk  Teachers of the law: \ft  Jewish men who had studied the Scriptures and taught them to the people. People usually thought highly of these teachers and treated them with honour. Most of teachers of the law opposed Jesus and his work.\ef* were angry that Jesus was acting like God. Jesus has power to make people well in their spirits and in their bodies. To prove this, Jesus also healed the manʼs body. Then Jesus met the \k tax collector\k*\ef -  \fr  9:1-17 \fk  Tax collector: \ft  Jews who collected money for the Roman government in Jesusʼ time. They werenʼt always honest. Often they made people give them more money than was required. The tax collectors would keep the money for themselves. Most Jews hated tax collectors for doing this and because they worked for their enemies the Romans. Tax collectors were often treated like outsiders. (See \w  outsiders\w* \xt Matthew 1:11-17\xt*.)\ef* named Matthew. The \k Pharisees\k*\ef -  \fr  9:1-17 \fk  Pharisees: \ft  A group of Jewish religious leaders in the first century. They urged Jews to work very hard to obey all the Old Testament laws. They didnʼt believe Jesus was the promised Messiah. The pharisees opposed Jesus and his teachings.\ef* werenʼt happy that Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners. Jesus explained that he had come to heal and save people who know they are sinners. Jesus brought a new way for people to be close to God.

\p 
\v 18 While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came. He got down on his knees in front of Jesus. He said, ‘My daughter has just died. But come and place your hand on her. Then she will live again.’ 
\v 19 Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples. 
\p 
\v 20 Just then a woman came up behind Jesus. She had an illness that made her bleed. It had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes. 
\v 21 She thought, ‘I only need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed.’ 
\p 
\v 22 Jesus turned and saw her. ‘Dear woman, donʼt give up hope,’ he said. ‘Your faith has healed you.’ The woman was healed at that moment. 
\p 
\v 23 When Jesus entered the synagogue leaderʼs house, he saw the noisy crowd and people playing flutes. 
\v 24 He said, ‘Go away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping.’ But they laughed at him. 
\v 25 After the crowd had been sent outside, Jesus went in. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up. 
\v 26 News about what Jesus had done spread all over that area. 
\p 
\v 27 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him. They called out, ‘Have mercy on us, Son of David!’ 
\p 
\v 28 When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, ‘Do you believe that I can do this?’ 
\p ‘Yes, Lord,’ they replied. 
\p 
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes. He said, ‘It will happen to you just as you believed.’ 
\v 30 They could now see again. Jesus strongly warned them, ‘Be sure that no one knows about this.’ 
\v 31 But they went out and spread the news. They talked about him all over that area. 
\p 
\v 32 While they were going out, another man was brought to Jesus. A demon controlled him, and he could not speak. 
\v 33 When the demon was driven out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, ‘Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.’ 
\p 
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, ‘He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons.’ 
\p 
\v 35 Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every illness and disease. 
\v 36 When he saw the crowds, he felt deep concern for them. They were treated badly and were helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
\v 37 Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘The harvest is huge. But there are only a few workers. 
\v 38 So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest field.’ 
\im  \bd  9:18-38\bd* Jesus invited all people to share in the new life of Godʼs kingdom. This included children, \k synagogue\k*\ef -  \fr  9:18-38 \fk  Synagogue: \ft  Places where Jews in the first century would gather to worship God. They would read the Scripture on the Sabbath day. Jewish teachers called rabbis would teach the people after reading from the Law of Moses and the Prophets. (See \w  Law of Moses\w* \xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*.) There were synagogues throughout the lands that were controlled by the Romans.\ef* leaders and people who were controlled by demons. It included blind men as well as women who were hurting. Some people saw Jesusʼ powerful works and had faith. They believed that he was the \k Son of David\k*\ef -  \fr  9:18-38 \fk  Son of David: \ft  A name used for Jesus to show he was Israelʼs true King and Messiah. God had promised King David that his kingdom would last for ever. This would happen because someone from his family line would be the messiah. Jesus was the promised ruler from Davidʼs family. (See \w  King David\w* \xt Matthew 1:1-17\xt*.)\ef*. They believed he had power from God over illness, death and evil.

\ip  But not everyone believed Jesusʼ power was from God. Some of Israelʼs leaders thought Jesusʼ power came from the \k prince of demons\k*\ef -  \fr  9:18-38 \fk  Prince of demons: \ft  An angel who stopped serving God. He is the leader of all spiritual powers. He opposes Godʼs work and Godʼs people. He is called the devil, the prince of this world, the prince of demons and Satan. He tells lies and accuses Godʼs people of doing wrong. He tries to make them be unfaithful to God. (See \w  demons\w* \xt Matthew 4:18-25\xt*. \w  Evil spirits\w* \xt Matthew 17:14-27\xt*.)\ef*. These leaders didnʼt take care of Godʼs people. Jesus was different. He saw the peopleʼs needs and worked hard to take care of them.

\v 7 As you go, preach this message, “The kingdom of heaven has come near.” 
\v 8 Heal those who are ill. Bring those who are dead back to life. Make those who have skin diseases “clean” again. Drive out demons. You have received freely, so give freely. 
\p 
\v 9 ‘Do not get any gold, silver or copper to take with you in your belts. 
\v 10 Do not take a bag for the journey. Do not take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. A worker should be given what he needs. 
\v 11 When you enter a town or village, look for someone who is willing to welcome you. Stay at their house until you leave. 
\v 12 As you enter the home, greet those who live there. 
\v 13 If that home welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it does not, donʼt bless it. 
\v 14 Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they donʼt, leave that home or town, and shake the dust off your feet. 
\v 15 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town. 
\im  \bd  10:1-15\bd* Jesus chose 12 men to be his most trusted followers, and they were called \k apostles\k*\ef -  \fr  10:1-15 \fk  Apostle: \ft  Jesusʼ 12 disciples and other close followers who become leaders in the first churches. The apostles taught people about Jesus and spread the good news about him. Apostle means someone who is sent.\ef*. Jesusʼ instructions to them were the second of his long messages in Matthewʼs gospel. He sent them out as partners in his work throughout Israel. Like Jesus, the disciples were to take care of people who were suffering. They were to preach about how Jesus was bringing Godʼs kingdom. They were to show this was true by healing peopleʼs bodies and driving out demons. They werenʼt to take money or extra clothes or supplies with them. Godʼs people should provide for the needs of Godʼs workers.

\p 
\v 16 ‘I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes and as harmless as doves. 
\v 17 Watch out! You will be handed over to the local courts. You will be whipped in the synagogues. 
\v 18 You will be brought to governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. 
\v 19 But when they arrest you, donʼt worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the right words to say. 
\v 20 It will not be you speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you. 
\p 
\v 21 ‘Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death. 
\v 22 You will be hated by everyone because of me. But anyone who remains strong in the faith will be saved. 
\v 23 When people attack you in one place, escape to another. What Iʼm about to tell you is true. You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. 
\p 
\v 24 ‘The student is not better than the teacher. A slave is not better than his master. 
\v 25 It is enough for students to be like their teachers. And it is enough for slaves to be like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, what can the others who live there expect? 
\p 
\v 26 ‘So donʼt be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is secret will be brought out into the open. Everything that is hidden will be uncovered. 
\v 27 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops. 
\v 28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but canʼt kill the soul. Instead, be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in hell. 
\v 29 Arenʼt two sparrows sold for only a penny? But not one of them falls to the ground outside your Fatherʼs care. 
\v 30 He even counts every hair on your head! 
\v 31 So donʼt be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows. 
\p 
\v 32 ‘What if someone says in front of others that they know me? I will also say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I know them. 
\v 33 But what if someone says in front of others that they donʼt know me? I will say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I donʼt know them. 
\p 
\v 34 ‘Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth. I didnʼt come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword. 
\v 35 I have come to turn 
\q1 ‘ “sons against their fathers. 
\q2 Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers. 
\q1 Daughters-in-law will be against their mothers-in-law. 
\q2 
\v 36 A manʼs enemies will be the members of his own family.” (\xt Micah 7:6\xt*) 
\p 
\v 37 ‘Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
\v 38 Whoever does not pick up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 
\v 39 Whoever finds their life will lose it. Whoever loses their life because of me will find it. 
\p 
\v 40 ‘Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. 
\v 41 Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. They will receive a prophetʼs reward. And suppose someone welcomes a godly person as a godly person. They will receive a godly personʼs reward. 
\v 42 Suppose someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little one who follows me. What Iʼm about to tell you is true. That person will certainly be rewarded.’ 
\im  \bd  10:16-42\bd* Jesus explained that following him could be very hard. His disciples needed to love him more than they loved anyone else. They must love him even more than they loved their families. Many people opposed Jesus. If the disciples remained faithful to him, they would be opposed and \k treated badly\k*\ef -  \fr  10:16-42 \fk  Treated badly for following Jesus: \ft  Many of Jesusʼ disciples and followers in the first churches were treated badly or killed. Other Jews made them suffer for following Jesus as the Jewish Messiah. They wanted Christian Jews to return to the Jewish faith and way of life. Roman authorities made them suffer for following Jesus as King of the whole world. They wanted Christians to recognise that the Roman emperor was king. The Roman government had laws that allowed people to practice the Jewish faith. But in the time of the first churches it didnʼt have laws about Christians. This meant that Christians could get in trouble for following Jesus. To avoid trouble, they could go back to living as Jews. This was one way to escape being treated badly. It was very tempting for Christians who were suffering. Many Christians today are also treated badly for faithfully following Jesus. (See \w  sacrifice\w* \xt Matthew 26:57-68\xt*.)\ef* too. Even their family members would turn against them because of their faith in Jesus. People might also harm the disciplesʼ bodies. But the real danger was if they stopped following Jesus. Then they would lose life together with him in Godʼs kingdom. Jesus reminded them how deeply God cared for them and was protecting their souls. Finding life with Jesus is worth giving up everything.

\c 11 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus finished teaching his 12 disciples. Then he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. 
\p 
\v 2 John the Baptist was in prison. When he heard about the actions of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to him. 
\v 3 They asked Jesus, ‘Are you the one who is supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?’ 
\p 
\v 4 Jesus replied, ‘Go back to John. Report to him what you hear and see. 
\v 5 Blind people receive sight. Disabled people walk. Those who have skin diseases are made “clean”. Deaf people hear. Those who are dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to those who are poor. 
\v 6 Blessed is anyone who does not give up their faith because of me.’ 
\p 
\v 7 As Johnʼs disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, ‘What did you go out into the desert to see? Tall grass waving in the wind? 
\v 8 If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in kingsʼ palaces. 
\v 9 Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 
\v 10 He is the one written about in Scripture. It says, 
\q1 ‘ “I will send my messenger ahead of you. 
\q2 He will prepare your way for you.” (\xt Malachi 3:1\xt*) 
\m 
\v 11 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. No one more important than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than he is. 
\v 12 Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been under attack. And violent people are taking hold of it. 
\v 13 All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came. 
\v 14 If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was supposed to come. 
\v 15 Whoever has ears should listen. 
\p 
\v 16 ‘What can I compare todayʼs people to? They are like children sitting in the markets and calling out to others. They say, 
\q1 
\v 17 ‘ “We played the flute for you. 
\q2 But you didnʼt dance. 
\q1 We sang a funeral song. 
\q2 But you didnʼt become sad.” 
\m 
\v 18 When John came, he didnʼt eat or drink as you do. And people say, “He has a demon.” 
\v 19 But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank as you do. And people say, “This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much. Heʼs a friend of tax collectors and ‘sinners’. ” By wise actions wisdom is shown to be right.’ 
\im  \bd  11:1-19\bd* John the Baptist had spoken about Israel being judged (Matthew 3). He didnʼt understand why \k judgement\k*\ef -  \fr  11:1-19 \fk  Judgement: \ft  When God corrects people for going against what he wants. He stops them from sinning and teaches them to obey him. Judgement can feel painful. But it allows people to live in peace with God and with one another.\ef* hadnʼt come on the nation yet. Jesus answered Johnʼs questions by using words from a \k prophecy\k*\ef -  \fr  11:1-19 \fk  Prophecy: \ft  An announcement about what God wants done or about what is going to happen. Prophets speak these messages from God. Many prophecies and stories recorded in the Old Testament point to Jesus. They show parts of Godʼs plan to rescue the world from evil, sin and death. They show Godʼs plan to send a Saviour. Writers in the New Testament talked about these stories and prophecies. They showed how Jesus is the Saviour God had promised to send. Godʼs promises come true through Jesus. Jesus completes the work God had been doing through Israel for hundreds of years.\ef* in \xt Isaiah 35:5-6\xt*. Jesus was the one through whom God was healing and setting his people free. Jesus called Israel to turn away from sin because it wasnʼt yet the time for judgement. It was time to heal and preach the good news of life in Godʼs kingdom. Jesus then explained that John was the messenger like Elijah whom God had promised to send. But not everyone in Israel accepted Jesus and John. 
\p 
\v 20 Jesus began to speak against the towns where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not turned away from their sins. So he said, 
\v 21 ‘How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible for you, Bethsaida! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon. They would have turned away from their sins long ago. They would have put on clothes for mourning. They would have sat down in ashes. 
\v 22 But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you. 
\v 23 And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be lifted to the heavens? No! You will go down to the place of the dead. Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom. It would still be here today. 
\v 24 But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for you.’ 
\p 
\v 25 At that time Jesus said, ‘I praise you, Father. You are Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from wise and educated people. But you have shown them to little children. 
\v 26 Yes, Father. This is what you wanted to do. 
\p 
\v 27 ‘My Father has given all things to me. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known. 
\p 
\v 28 ‘Come to me, all you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads. I will give you rest. 
\v 29 Become my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and free of pride. You will find rest for your souls. 
\v 30 Serving me is easy, and my load is light.’ 
\im  \bd  11:20-30\bd* God was working among the people of Israel through Jesus. Yet they didnʼt accept Jesus and his message of good news. Jesus warned them about what would happen if they continued to say no to God. He talked about cities from long ago that were famous for evil deeds. The people who had lived in those cities never saw Jesusʼ powerful signs. Jesus said that if they had, they would have turned away from their sin. Yet the Jewish cities in Galilee werenʼt turning away from sin and towards God. Jesus saw that religious duties were like heavy loads that people carried around. He wanted them to really know God as their Father. Following and serving Jesus gives people rest. He invited all people to the way of his rest and peace.

\c 12 
\p 
\v 1 One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the cornfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some ears of corn and eat them. 
\v 2 The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ‘Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath day. But your disciples are doing it anyway!’ 
\p 
\v 3 Jesus answered, ‘Havenʼt you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. 
\v 4 So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it. 
\v 5 Havenʼt you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty. 
\v 6 I tell you that something more important than the temple is here. 
\v 7 Scripture says, “I want mercy and not sacrifice.” (\xt Hosea 6:6\xt*) You donʼt know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty. 
\v 8 The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.’ 
\p 
\v 9 Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue. 
\v 10 A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to accuse Jesus of a crime. So they asked him, ‘Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?’ 
\p 
\v 11 He said to them, ‘What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath day? Wonʼt you take hold of it and lift it out? 
\v 12 A person is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.’ 
\p 
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the man, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ So he stretched it out. It had been made as good as new. It was just as good as the other hand. 
\v 14 But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. 
\im  \bd  12:1-14\bd* Jesusʼ disciples broke off some ears of corn and ate them on the \k Sabbath day\k*\ef -  \fr  12:1-14 \fk  Sabbath day: \ft  The seventh day of the week for Jews. It was a holy day when faithful Jews rested and didnʼt work. It was to honour how God rested after creating the world. It also honoured the rest God gave Israel after freeing them from slavery in Egypt. It reminded Jews that God is good and wants his people to live in peace. The religious leaders had made many rules about what was allowed on the Sabbath day. These rules didnʼt always help people honour God. Jesus understood what God really wanted for his people on the Sabbath day. Even though the leaders opposed him, he did mighty works on the Sabbath day.\ef*. Because of this the Pharisees accused them of breaking the law. Jesus reminded them that David broke the law when he was hungry. \k Priests\k*\ef -  \fr  12:1-14 \fk  Priest: \ft  A man from Aaronʼs family line who served in Godʼs holy tent or later in the temple. Priests made sacrifices for the people to God. They followed special laws about being pure. This allowed them to touch holy things. It also allowed them to be close to God in the holy tent or temple. People who werenʼt priests werenʼt allowed to do those things.\ef* also broke the law every Sabbath day when they worked in the temple. Jesus was claiming that he had the same rights as King David. And his work was more important than priestsʼ work in the temple. Then Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath even though the Pharisees didnʼt want him to. Jesus wouldnʼt stop doing Godʼs work just because some opposed him. The Pharisees then started making plans to kill Jesus.

\p 
\v 15 Jesus knew all about the Phariseesʼ plans. So he left that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. 
\v 16 But he warned them not to tell other people about him. 
\v 17 This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says, 
\q1 
\v 18 ‘Here is my servant. I have chosen him. 
\q2 He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. 
\q1 I will put my Spirit on him. 
\q2 He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right. 
\q1 
\v 19 He will not argue or cry out. 
\q2 No one will hear his voice in the streets. 
\q1 
\v 20 He will not break a bent twig. 
\q2 He will not put out a dimly burning flame. 
\q1 He will make right win over wrong. 
\q2 
\v 21 The nations will put their hope in him.’ (\xt Isaiah 42:1-4\xt*) 
\im  \bd  12:15-21\bd* Many years before, God made a promise recorded in the book of the prophet Isaiah. A promise like this is called a prophecy. Matthew showed that Jesusʼ actions fulfilled that prophecy. Jesus was the servant God sent into the world. He spoke and worked for justice. He was tender towards those who were hurting. He encouraged those who had been harmed. In the end, his victory would bring what is good and true to all nations.

\p 
\v 22 A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see. 
\v 23 All the people were amazed. They said, ‘Could this be the Son of David?’ 
\p 
\v 24 The Pharisees heard this. So they said, ‘This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons.’ 
\p 
\v 25 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, ‘Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand. 
\v 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand? 
\v 27 You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 
\v 28 But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then the kingdom of God has come to you. 
\p 
\v 29 ‘Or think about this. How can you enter a strong manʼs house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house. 
\p 
\v 30 ‘Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them. 
\v 31 So here is what I tell you. Every kind of sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. 
\v 32 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that wonʼt be forgiven either now or in days to come. 
\p 
\v 33 ‘If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make a tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit. 
\v 34 You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts. 
\v 35 A good man says good things. These come from the good that is stored up inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is stored up inside him. 
\v 36 But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, everyone will have to account for every empty word they have spoken. 
\v 37 By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty.’ 
\im  \bd  12:22-37\bd* Jesus healed a man who couldnʼt see or speak and drove demons out of him. The Pharisees claimed that Jesus used the power of Satan to do this. But people who say that \k Satan\k*\ef -  \fr  12:22-37 \fk  Satan: \ft  An angel who stopped serving God. He is the leader of all spiritual powers. He opposes Godʼs work and Godʼs people. He is called the devil, the prince of this world, the prince of demons and Satan. He tells lies and accuses Godʼs people of doing wrong. He tries to make them be unfaithful to God. (See \w  demons\w* \xt Matthew 4:18-25\xt*. \w  Evil spirits\w* \xt Matthew 17:14-27\xt*.)\ef* gives Jesus power are speaking evil against Godʼs Spirit. Jesus wanted people to understand that good deeds and evil deeds come from the \k heart.\k*\ef -  \fr  12:22-37 \fk  Heart: \ft  The spiritual part of people where their feelings are. In the Bible, the heart is more than the part of the body that beats. People make decisions about what to do and what to worship in their heart.\ef* He used a tree to explain what he meant. He said good deeds are like good fruit. A good tree produces good fruit. Bad deeds are like bad fruit. A bad tree produces bad fruit. The way people act shows what is inside their hearts. Jesus came to rescue people from sin and to give them hearts that love God. 
\p 
\v 38 Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, ‘Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.’ 
\p 
\v 39 He answered, ‘Evil and unfaithful people ask for a sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 
\v 40 Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave. 
\v 41 The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now something more important than Jonah is here. 
\v 42 The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to listen to Solomonʼs wisdom. And now something more important than Solomon is here. 
\p 
\v 43 ‘What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest. But it doesnʼt find it. 
\v 44 Then it says, “I will return to the house I left.” When it arrives there, it finds the house empty. The house has been swept clean and put in order. 
\v 45 Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and live there. That person is worse off than before. That is how it will be with the evil people of today.’ 
\p 
\v 46 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to speak to him. 
\v 47 Someone told him, ‘Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you.’ 
\p 
\v 48 Jesus replied to him, ‘Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?’ 
\v 49 Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, ‘Here is my mother! Here are my brothers! 
\v 50 Anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.’ 
\im  \bd  12:38-50\bd* Jesus had done many mighty works of healing throughout Israel. Some religious leaders asked Jesus for one more sign. But they had already decided that they didnʼt \k believe in Jesus\k*\ef -  \fr  12:38-50 \fk  Believe in Jesus: \ft  To trust that Jesus is who he says he is. Jesus is a human being and he is Godʼs Son. He died on a cross and God raised him from the dead three days later. When he rose from the dead, he won the victory over sin, death and evil. He is the true King of all that God created. Everyone who believes the truth about Jesus is saved from sin, death and evil. Jesus gives them life that never ends. People who believe in him obey him and follow his way of life.\ef* or want to follow him. Jesusʼ sign would be like the prophet \k Jonah\k*\ef -  \fr  12:38-50 \fk  Jonah: \ft  A prophet in the northern kingdom of Israel when Jeroboam II was king. After spending three days inside a huge fish, he preached to the city of Nineveh. The Assyrians who lived there stopped doing evil and God forgave them their sins.\ef*ʼs sign from long ago. Jonah spent three days and nights inside a huge fish. Then he came back out and preached Godʼs message. Something like this would happen to Jesus. Jesus would be dead for three days and then he would come out of the grave. Jesusʼ message about Godʼs kingdom is greater than Jonahʼs message. Itʼs even greater than \k Solomon\k*\ef -  \fr  12:38-50 \fk  Solomon: \ft  The son of David and Bathsheba who became king. He was king when the temple was built in Jerusalem. He was very wise and very rich. He stopped being faithful to God. This led to Israel and Judah separating into two kingdoms.\ef*ʼs wisdom. Jesus explained that those who didnʼt believe his message would be judged. Yet everyone who does believe in him and who obeys God is part of his family.

\p 
\v 1 That same day Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee. 
\v 2 Large crowds gathered around him. So he got into a boat and sat down. All the people stood on the shore. 
\v 3 Then he told them many things using stories. He said, ‘A farmer went out to plant his seed. 
\v 4 He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up. 
\v 5 Some seed fell on rocky places, where there wasnʼt much soil. The plants came up quickly, because the soil wasnʼt deep. 
\v 6 When the sun came up, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots. 
\v 7 Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants. 
\v 8 Still other seed fell on good soil. It produced a crop 100, 60 or 30 times more than what was planted. 
\v 9 Whoever has ears should listen.’ 
\p 
\v 10 The disciples came to him. They asked, ‘Why do you use stories when you speak to the people?’ 
\p 
\v 11 He replied, ‘Because you have been given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to outsiders. 
\v 12 Everyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more knowledge. In fact, they will have very much. If anyone doesnʼt have this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken away from them. 
\v 13 Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people. I say, 
\q1 ‘They look, but they donʼt really see. 
\q2 They listen, but they donʼt really hear or understand. 
\m 
\v 14 In them the words of the prophet Isaiah come true. He said, 
\q1 ‘ “You will hear but never understand. 
\q2 You will see but never know what you are seeing. 
\q1 
\v 15 The hearts of these people have become stubborn. 
\q2 They can barely hear with their ears. 
\q2 They have closed their eyes. 
\q1 Otherwise they might see with their eyes. 
\q2 They might hear with their ears. 
\q2 They might understand with their hearts. 
\q1 They might turn to the Lord, and then he would heal them.” (\xt Isaiah 6:9,10\xt*) 
\m 
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes because they see. And blessed are your ears because they hear. 
\v 17 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. Many prophets and godly people wanted to see what you see. But they didnʼt see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didnʼt hear it. 
\p 
\v 18 ‘Listen! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer. 
\v 19 People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was planted in their hearts. Those people are like the seed planted on a path. 
\v 20 The seed that fell on rocky places is like other people. They hear the message and at once receive it with joy. 
\v 21 But they have no roots. So they last only a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message. 
\v 22 The seed that fell among the thorns is like others who hear the message. But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep the message from producing fruit. 
\v 23 But the seed that fell on good soil is like those who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60 or 30 times more than the farmer planted.’ 
\im  \bd  13:1-23\bd* When Jesus first began to work and serve the people, he spoke openly. He announced the kingdom of heaven and invited people to be part of it. But the religious leaders refused to accept his teaching. And many people in Israel doubted that Jesus really was the promised Messiah. Because of this, Jesus changed the way he taught in Israel. He stopped speaking plainly and instead taught by telling stories called \k parables\k*\ef -  \fr  13:1-23 \fk  Parables: \ft  Stories that Jesus told to help people understand Godʼs ways and Godʼs kingdom. The stories used events, places and actions from peopleʼs real lives. They usually had one main point.\ef*. This was the way he tried to show people the truth about God.

\ip  This was the start of Jesusʼ third long message. It was full of stories about Godʼs kingdom. Jesus told the story about seeds in public to everyone. But he only explained it in private to his disciples. Many hear the message about the kingdom, but most refuse to understand it. Yet God is still working. Some people hear Jesusʼ message and obey him. They are like seeds that produce a good crop. Words and actions that accomplish what God wants are the good crop.

\p 
\v 24 Jesus told the crowd another story. ‘Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like,’ he said. ‘A man planted good seed in his field. 
\v 25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away. 
\v 26 The wheat began to grow and form corn. At the same time, weeds appeared. 
\p 
\v 27 ‘The ownerʼs slaves came to him. They said, “Sir, didnʼt you plant good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?” 
\p 
\v 28 ‘ “An enemy did this,” he replied. 
\p ‘The slaves asked him, “Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?” 
\p 
\v 29 ‘ “No”, the owner answered. “While you are pulling up the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them. 
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them. First collect the weeds. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my storeroom.” ’ 
\p 
\v 31 Jesus told the crowd another story. He said, ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field. 
\v 32 It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of all garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.’ 
\p 
\v 33 Jesus told them still another story. ‘The kingdom of heaven is like yeast,’ he said. ‘A woman mixed it into 30 kilograms of flour. The yeast worked its way all through the dough.’ 
\p 
\v 34 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd using stories. He did not say anything to them without telling a story. 
\v 35 So the words spoken by the prophet came true. He had said, 
\q1 ‘I will open my mouth and tell stories. 
\q2 I will speak about things that were hidden since the world was made.’ (\xt Psalm 78:2\xt*) 
\p 
\v 36 Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said, ‘Explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.’ 
\p 
\v 37 He answered, ‘The one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man. 
\v 38 The field is the world. The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one. 
\v 39 The enemy who plants them is the devil. The harvest is judgment day. And the workers are angels. 
\p 
\v 40 ‘The weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on judgment day. 
\v 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels. They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin. They will also get rid of all who do evil. 
\v 42 They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There people will weep and grind their teeth. 
\v 43 Then Godʼs people will shine like the sun in their Fatherʼs kingdom. Whoever has ears should listen. 
\p 
\v 44 ‘The kingdom of heaven is like treasure that was hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field. 
\p 
\v 45 ‘Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls. 
\v 46 He found one that was very valuable. So he went away and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. 
\p 
\v 47 ‘Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was let down into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish. 
\v 48 When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away. 
\v 49 This is how it will be on judgment day. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did what is wrong from those who did what is right. 
\v 50 They will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace. There the evil ones will weep and grind their teeth. 
\p 
\v 51 ‘Do you understand all these things?’ Jesus asked. 
\p ‘Yes’, they replied. 
\p 
\v 52 He said to them, ‘Every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones.’ 
\im  \bd  13:24-52\bd* Jesusʼ stories taught about his work and the coming of the kingdom of heaven. Jesusʼ work didnʼt stop Satanʼs evil powers everywhere all at once. Evil is allowed to remain along with the kingdom for now. Later, judgement will come and evil will be destroyed. For now, Godʼs kingdom will slowly grow and spread through the whole world. All nations and all peoples can be part of it. Everyone who is part of Godʼs kingdom will find rest, safety and peace.

\ip  This new understanding of Godʼs kingdom is like a treasure. Some people recognise that Jesus is from God and they understand what he is doing. These people understand the value of this treasure.

\p 
\v 53 Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he moved on from there. 
\v 54 He came to his home town of Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. ‘Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?’ they asked. 
\v 55 ‘Isnʼt this the carpenterʼs son? Isnʼt his motherʼs name Mary? Arenʼt his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? 
\v 56 Arenʼt all his sisters with us? Then where did this man get all these things?’ 
\v 57 They were not pleased with him at all. 
\p But Jesus said to them, ‘A prophet is honoured everywhere except in his own town and in his own home.’ 
\p 
\v 58 He did only a few miracles in Nazareth because the people there had no faith. 
\c 14 
\p 
\v 1 At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus. 
\v 2 He said to his attendants, ‘This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles.’ 
\p 
\v 3 Herod had arrested John. He had tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herodʼs brother Philip. 
\v 4 John had been saying to Herod, ‘It is against the Law for you to have her as your wife.’ 
\v 5 Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they thought John was a prophet. 
\p 
\v 6 On Herodʼs birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased Herod very much. 
\v 7 So he promised to give her anything she asked for. 
\v 8 Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, ‘Give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate.’ 
\v 9 The king was very upset. But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for. 
\v 10 Herod had Johnʼs head cut off in the prison. 
\v 11 His head was brought in on a big plate and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother. 
\v 12 Johnʼs disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. 
\im  \bd  13:53 - 14:12\bd* People in Jesusʼ hometown didnʼt understand where Jesus got his wisdom. They were confused by his powerful works. This made them angry and they refused to believe he came from God. At the same time, Jewish and Roman leaders were angry at John the Baptist. John had told \k Herod Antipas\k*\ef -  \fr  13:53 - 14:12 \fk  Herod Antipas: \ft  The Herod of Matthew 14, Mark 6, and Luke 3, 9 and 23. He was a son of Herod the Great. He ruled in Galilee and Perea during Jesusʼ time. He had John the Baptist put to death.  \ef* that he was sinning by marrying his brother \k Philip\k*\ef -  \fr  13:53 - 14:12 \fk  Philip son of Herod: \ft  The Philip of Matthew 14, Mark 6 and Luke 3. He was a son of Herod the Great. He ruled over the areas of Iturea and Traconitus during Jesusʼ time. He was married to Herodias until his half-brother Herod Antipas married her.\ef*ʼs wife. Herod put John in prison and later had Johnʼs head cut off. Both John and Jesus were treated without honour or respect for sharing Godʼs message.

\p 
\v 13 Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns. 
\v 14 When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep concern for them. He healed their ill people. 
\p 
\v 15 When it was almost evening, the disciples came to him. ‘There is nothing here,’ they said. ‘Itʼs already getting late. Send the crowds away. They can go and buy some food in the villages.’ 
\p 
\v 16 Jesus replied, ‘They donʼt need to go away. You give them something to eat.’ 
\p 
\v 17 ‘We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,’ they answered. 
\p 
\v 18 ‘Bring them here to me,’ he said. 
\v 19 Then Jesus instructed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people. 
\v 20 All of them ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftover pieces. 
\v 21 The number of men who ate was about 5,000. Women and children also ate. 
\im  \bd  14:13-21\bd* When Jesus heard about John the Baptistʼs death, he was very sad. He wanted to be alone, but the crowds found him and surrounded him. Jesus was Israelʼs healer. He cared deeply for them, and he healed those who were ill. 
\ip  Next Matthew recorded the first of two \k miracles\k*\ef -  \fr  14:13-21 \fk  Miracle: \ft  A mighty work from God who has full power to do anything in his creation. Jesus performed Godʼs mighty works when he was on earth. He gave his followers the power to do miracles also.\ef* that Jesus performed to feed people. Godʼs kingdom grows when his people are willing to freely give what they have. It doesnʼt matter how small the gift is. The disciples had only five loaves and two fish to offer. Jesus used the little food that the disciples gave to feed over 5,000 people. 
\p 
\v 22 Right away Jesus made the disciples get into the boat. He had them go on ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then he sent the crowd away. 
\v 23 After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone. 
\v 24 The boat was already a long way from land. It was being pounded by the waves because the wind was blowing against it. 
\p 
\v 25 Shortly before dawn, Jesus went out to the disciples. He walked on the lake. 
\v 26 They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. ‘Itʼs a ghost!’ they said. And they cried out in fear. 
\p 
\v 27 Right away Jesus called out to them, ‘Be brave! It is I. Donʼt be afraid.’ 
\p 
\v 28 ‘Lord, is it you?’ Peter asked. ‘If it is, tell me to come to you on the water.’ 
\p 
\v 29 ‘Come’, Jesus said. 
\p So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water towards Jesus. 
\v 30 But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, ‘Lord! Save me!’ 
\p 
\v 31 Right away Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. ‘Your faith is so small!’ he said. ‘Why did you doubt me?’ 
\p 
\v 32 When they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. 
\v 33 Then those in the boat worshipped Jesus. They said, ‘You really are the Son of God!’ 
\p 
\v 34 They crossed over the lake and landed at Gennesaret. 
\v 35 The men who lived there recognised Jesus. So they sent a message all over the nearby countryside. People brought all those who were ill to Jesus. 
\v 36 They begged him to let those who were ill just touch the edge of his clothes. And all who touched his clothes were healed. 
\im  \bd  14:22-36\bd* Jesus sent the crowd and his disciples away so that he could be alone. He wanted to pray. In prayer he was encouraged and strengthened to continue serving and doing Godʼs work. When Jesus walked on the water the disciples saw his authority over nature. They were scared, but Jesus spoke comforting words. \it  ‘Be brave! It is I. Donʼt be afraid.’\it* Peter had faith to follow Jesus on the water at first. When Peter got scared, Jesus saved him from sinking. Then Jesus continued to show his authority over nature and illness as he healed people. His power is so strong that people were healed even by touching his clothes. 
\c 15 
\p 
\v 1 Some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked, 
\v 2 ‘Why donʼt your disciples obey what the elders teach? Your disciples donʼt wash their hands before they eat!’ 
\p 
\v 3 Jesus replied, ‘And why donʼt you obey Godʼs command? You would rather follow your own teachings! 
\v 4 God said, “Honour your father and mother.” (\xt Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16\xt*) He also said, “Anyone who asks for bad things to happen to their father or mother must be put to death.” (\xt Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9\xt*) 
\v 5 But suppose people have something that might be used to help their parents. You allow them to say it is instead “a gift set apart for God.” 
\v 6 So they do not need to honour their father or mother with their gift. You make the word of God useless in order to follow your own teachings. 
\v 7 You pretenders! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said, 
\q1 
\v 8 ‘ “These people honour me by what they say. 
\q2 But their hearts are far away from me. 
\q1 
\v 9 Their worship doesnʼt mean anything to me. 
\q2 They teach nothing but human rules.” ’ (\xt Isaiah 29:13\xt*) 
\p 
\v 10 Jesus called the crowd to him. He said, ‘Listen and understand. 
\v 11 What goes into someoneʼs mouth does not make them “unclean”. Itʼs what comes out of their mouth that makes them “unclean”. ’ 
\p 
\v 12 Then the disciples came to him. They asked, ‘Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?’ 
\p 
\v 13 Jesus replied, ‘They are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted. They will be pulled up by the roots. 
\v 14 Leave the Pharisees. They are blind guides. If one blind person leads another blind person, both of them will fall into a pit.’ 
\p 
\v 15 Peter said, ‘Explain this to us.’ 
\p 
\v 16 ‘Donʼt you understand yet?’ Jesus asked them. 
\v 17 ‘Donʼt you see? Everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it goes out of the body. 
\v 18 But the things that come out of a personʼs mouth come from the heart. Those are the things that make someone “unclean”. 
\v 19 Evil thoughts come out of a personʼs heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so do stealing, false witness, and telling lies about others. 
\v 20 Those are the things that make you “unclean”. But eating without washing your hands does not make you “unclean”. ’ 
\im  \bd  15:1-20\bd* The Pharisees asked Jesus why his disciples didnʼt obey the teachings of the \k Jewish elders\k*\ef -  \fr  15:1-20 \fk  Jewish elders: \ft  Jewish male leaders and teachers who made important decisions for Godʼs people. They were called the Sanhedrin or the Jewish Council. They were also called the elders of the people. They passed down Jewish teachings through the years. Most elders opposed Jesus and his teaching.\ef*. Jesus asked them why they didnʼt obey Godʼs command to honour their mother and father. Jesus said that obeying \k Godʼs word\k*\ef -  \fr  15:1-20 \fk  Godʼs word or word of God: \ft  In Jesusʼ time, Godʼs word was understood to be the Jewish Scriptures of the Old Testament. For believers in the New Testament times, Godʼs word also included Jesusʼ teachings. The apostles preached Godʼs word. This included the message about Jesus in the Old Testament and everything Jesus taught.\ef* is more important than obeying human teachings and practices.

\ip  Jesus taught what Godʼs laws about being \k clean\k*\ef -  \fr  15:1-20 \fk  Clean and unclean: \ft  The way that the Jewish laws described things that could or couldnʼt be near God. In the Bible, clean things were pure and unclean things were impure. These words have a spiritual meaning and mean more than being dirty or clean. People who were clean could be fully part of Godʼs people. Unclean people had to stay separate and couldnʼt worship God together with others.\ef* really meant. What made someone \it  unclean\it*? It wasnʼt what they ate or whether they washed their hands or not. There were many teachings and practices that caused problems for Israel. These things kept Godʼs people from sharing his love with the whole world. Jesus showed what wasnʼt true about these teachings and practices. Being unclean comes from inside a person. Evil words and actions come from someoneʼs heart. Jesusʼ work was to teach people what God wants them to do instead.

\p 
\v 21 Jesus left Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon. 
\v 22 A woman from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, ‘Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon controls my daughter. She is suffering terribly.’ 
\p 
\v 23 Jesus did not say a word. So his disciples came to him. They begged him, ‘Send her away. She keeps crying out after us.’ 
\p 
\v 24 Jesus answered, ‘I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.’ 
\p 
\v 25 Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. ‘Lord! Help me!’ she said. 
\p 
\v 26 He replied, ‘It is not right to take the childrenʼs bread and throw it to the dogs.’ 
\p 
\v 27 ‘Yes it is, Lord,’ she said. ‘Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their ownerʼs table.’ 
\p 
\v 28 Then Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, you have great faith! You will be given what you are asking for.’ And her daughter was healed at that moment. 
\im  \bd  15:21-28\bd* Jesus left the Jewish areas and went to \k Gentile\k*\ef -  \fr  15:21-28 \fk  Gentiles: \ft  Everyone who wasnʼt a Jew. Gentiles werenʼt from Jacobʼs family line and hadnʼt accepted the Jewish faith. Most Gentiles in the first century didnʼt know about Israelʼs God or Israelʼs history. They didnʼt know about Jewish laws and didnʼt follow the Law of Moses (\xt Matthew 5:13-20\xt*).\ef* territory. A woman who wasnʼt a Jew spoke to Jesus. She called him \it  Lord! Son of David!\it* This showed that she recognised who Jesus really was. She asked Jesus to heal her daughter who was controlled by a demon. She kept begging him and didnʼt stop. Jesus answered that his work was for the people of Israel. Yet the woman didnʼt give up. Jesus praised her bold faith and healed her daughter. 
\p 
\v 29 Jesus left there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. 
\v 30 Large crowds came to him. They brought blind people and those who could not walk. They also brought disabled people, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them. 
\v 31 The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were made well. Those not able to walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel. 
\p 
\v 32 Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said, ‘I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They donʼt have anything to eat. I donʼt want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way home.’ 
\p 
\v 33 His disciples answered him. ‘There is nothing here,’ they said. ‘Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd?’ 
\p 
\v 34 ‘How many loaves do you have?’ Jesus asked. 
\p ‘Seven’, they replied, ‘and a few small fish.’ 
\p 
\v 35 Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. 
\v 36 He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples passed them out to the people. 
\v 37 All of them ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces. 
\v 38 The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate. 
\v 39 After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan. 
\im  \bd  15:29-39\bd* Back in Galilee, Jesus was once again on a mountainside surrounded by a large crowd. Many in the crowd were ill or disabled. Jesus had deep concern for those who needed help. He healed their bodies and fed them when they were hungry. These were signs of what life in Godʼs kingdom is like. People who are hurting and needy will be made well. People who are hungry will be fed. God will be known and honoured as the true Ruler. 
\c 16 
\p 
\v 1 The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 
\p 
\v 2 He replied, ‘In the evening you look at the sky. You say, “It will be good weather. The sky is red.” 
\v 3 And in the morning you say, “Today it will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.” You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you canʼt understand the signs of what is happening right now. 
\v 4 An evil and unfaithful people look for a sign. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.’ Then Jesus left them and went away. 
\p 
\v 5 The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to take bread. 
\v 6 ‘Be careful’, Jesus said to them. ‘Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ 
\p 
\v 7 The disciples talked about this among themselves. They said, ‘He must be saying this because we didnʼt bring any bread.’ 
\p 
\v 8 Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, ‘Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread? 
\v 9 Donʼt you understand yet? Donʼt you remember the five loaves for the 5,000? Donʼt you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered? 
\v 10 Donʼt you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000? Donʼt you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered? 
\v 11 How can you possibly not understand? I wasnʼt talking to you about bread. But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ 
\v 12 Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. 
\im  \bd  16:1-12\bd* The \k Sadducees\k*\ef -  \fr  16:1-12 \fk  Sadducees: \ft  A group of Jewish religious leaders in the first century. They were in charge of the temple and worked closely with Roman rulers. They didnʼt believe in angels or that God raised people from the dead. And they didnʼt believe that Jesus was the promised Messiah.\ef* were the Jewish leaders with the most authority in Jerusalem. They worked closely with the \k Roman rulers\k*\ef -  \fr  16:1-12 \fk  Rome or Roman government: \ft  The Roman government ruled over many other nations and peoples for several hundred years. It ruled over Israel during the first century. It was led by powerful emperors. People worshipped the emperor as a god. The capital city was called Rome. The Roman government treated most of the people it ruled over badly.\ef*. The Pharisees werenʼt official leaders and didnʼt have authority from Rome. But they were well known and respected in Israel. These two groups of leaders often disagreed, but they worked together to oppose Jesus. The Sadducees and Pharisees didnʼt really want to see the mighty works of Jesus. They wanted to trap him and harm him. So Jesus warned his followers about these sinful leaders. They taught the people of Israel things that werenʼt true. They were leading the people away from obeying God. 
\p 
\v 13 Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, ‘Who do people say the Son of Man is?’ 
\p 
\v 14 They replied, ‘Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.’ 
\p 
\v 15 ‘But what about you?’ he asked. ‘Who do you say I am?’ 
\p 
\v 16 Simon Peter answered, ‘You are the Messiah. You are the Son of the living God.’ 
\p 
\v 17 Jesus replied, ‘Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah! No mere human showed this to you. My Father in heaven showed it to you. 
\v 18 Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it. 
\v 19 I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.’ 
\v 20 Then Jesus ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. 
\p 
\v 21 From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again. 
\p 
\v 22 Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him. ‘Never, Lord!’ he said. ‘This will never happen to you!’ 
\p 
\v 23 Jesus turned and said to Peter, ‘Get behind me, Satan! You are standing in my way. You do not have in mind the things God cares about. Instead, you only have in mind the things humans care about.’ 
\p 
\v 24 Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, ‘Whoever wants to be my disciple must say no to themselves. They must pick up their cross and follow me. 
\v 25 Whoever wants to save their life will lose it. But whoever loses their life for me will find it. 
\v 26 What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses their soul? Or what can anyone trade for their soul? 
\v 27 The Son of Man is going to come in his Fatherʼs glory. His angels will come with him. And he will reward everyone in keeping with what they have done. 
\im  \bd  16:13-27\bd* Jesus asked his disciples who they believed he was. God had shown them that Jesus was more than a prophet. Jesus is Godʼs Son, the Messiah. He is Israelʼs true King. Jesus then taught the disciples that Israelʼs King would suffer and die. Peter was angry and said that shouldnʼt happen. The Jews believed the messiah would be a warrior who would destroy all their enemies. Their biggest enemy at that time was the Roman government. But Jesus didnʼt promise to destroy the Romans. Instead, he said that following him was like carrying a Roman \k cross\k*\ef -  \fr  16:13-27 \fk  Cross: \ft  Two pieces of wood put together so a person can be nailed onto it. The Romans killed criminals this way. This process is called crucifixion. The cross was a sign of terror and death. Here Jesus talked about the cross to show how his followers must be willing to suffer.\ef* and dying. He was talking about how hard itʼs to be fully committed to obeying God. His followers must say no to everything that doesnʼt honour God. Some of Jesusʼ disciples would actually be killed for being faithful to him. But all who believe in Jesus and follow him will receive new life through his \k resurrection\k*\ef -  \fr  16:13-27 \fk  Resurrection: \ft  Rising from the dead to live again. Jews disagreed about whether or not there would be a resurrection after people died. Jesus brought some people back to life again after they had died. Yet those people didnʼt live forever. They died again later on. That isnʼt what happened to Jesus. God raised Jesus from the dead in a new kind of resurrection. He lived a new kind of life in his body after that. He never died again. God will one day bring all people who have died back to life.\ef*.

\v 28 ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.’ 
\c 17 
\p 
\v 1 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were all alone. 
\v 2 There in front of them his appearance was changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became as white as the light. 
\v 3 Just then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus. 
\p 
\v 4 Peter said to Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters. One will be for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ 
\p 
\v 5 While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them. A voice from the cloud said, ‘This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!’ 
\p 
\v 6 When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell with their faces to the ground. 
\v 7 But Jesus came and touched them. ‘Get up’, he said. ‘Donʼt be afraid.’ 
\v 8 When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus. 
\p 
\v 9 They came down the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. ‘Donʼt tell anyone what you have seen,’ he said. ‘Wait until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.’ 
\p 
\v 10 The disciples asked him, ‘Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?’ 
\p 
\v 11 Jesus replied, ‘Thatʼs right. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again. 
\v 12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come. People didnʼt recognise him. They have done to him everything they wanted to do. In the same way, they are going to make the Son of Man suffer.’ 
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist. 
\im  \bd  16:28 - 17:13\bd* Jesus took his three most trusted disciples up a mountain. Peter, \k James\k*\ef -  \fr  16:28 - 17:13 \fk  James the apostle: \ft  One of Jesusʼ 12 disciples and one of his three closest followers. His brother was John, and their father was Zebedee. Jesus called them sons of thunder. James was the first apostle to be put to death for being faithful to Jesus.\ef* and \k John\k*\ef -  \fr  16:28 - 17:13 \fk  John the apostle: \ft  The writer of the Gospel of John. He also wrote the books of 1, 2 and 3 John. Itʼs thought that John also wrote the book of Revelation. He was one of Jesusʼ 12 disciples and one of his three closest followers. In the Gospel of John he is called ‘the disciple whom Jesus loved’. His brother was James, and their father was Zebedee. Jesus called them sons of thunder.\ef* saw Jesusʼ \k glory\k*\ef -  \fr  16:28 - 17:13 \fk  Glory: \ft  The wonderful beauty and presence of God. Itʼs a way of talking about who God is and how pure and holy he is. Only the Creator has this glory. He chooses to share it with those he has created. Created beings show Godʼs glory when they carry out his good plans for his creation.\ef* as the \k Son of Man\k*\ef -  \fr  16:28 - 17:13 \fk  Son of Man: \ft  Someone who appeared in a vision that the prophet Daniel had (\xt Daniel 7:13-15\xt*). In the vision, the son of man saved Israel from their enemies. Jesus called himself the Son of Man. It was a way to talk about how he is human and has Godʼs authority. As the Son of Man he would suffer. Then he would win victory over Godʼs enemies. He would do this for all humans.\ef*. Then Moses and Elijah both appeared. The disciples were getting to see who Jesus is in Godʼs kingdom. Everything from Israelʼs past led to Jesus. Moses had been the leader when God gave Israel the Law. Elijah had been a very important prophet in Israel. But Jesus is Godʼs Son, and his work accomplishes all of Godʼs purposes. Jesus told the three disciples not to tell others what they had seen on the mountain. They werenʼt to talk about it until he had been \k raised from the dead\k*\ef -  \fr  16:28 - 17:13 \fk  Resurrection: \ft  Rising from the dead to live again. Jews disagreed about whether or not there would be a resurrection after people died. Jesus brought some people back to life again after they had died. Yet those people didnʼt live forever. They died again later on. That isnʼt what happened to Jesus. God raised Jesus from the dead in a new kind of resurrection. He lived a new kind of life in his body after that. He never died again. God will one day bring all people who have died back to life.\ef*. 
\p 
\v 14 When they came near the crowd, a man approached Jesus. He got on his knees in front of him. 
\v 15 ‘Lord’, he said, ‘have mercy on my son. He shakes wildly and suffers a great deal. He often falls into the fire or into the water. 
\v 16 I brought him to your disciples. But they couldnʼt heal him.’ 
\p 
\v 17 ‘You unbelieving and evil people!’ Jesus replied. ‘How long do I have to stay with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.’ 
\v 18 Jesus ordered the demon to leave the boy, and it came out of him. He was healed at that moment. 
\p 
\v 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, ‘Why couldnʼt we drive out the demon?’ 
\p 
\v 20-21 He replied, ‘Because your faith is much too small. What Iʼm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, “Move from here to there.” And it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.’ 
\p 
\v 22 They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, ‘The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men. 
\v 23 They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead.’ Then the disciples were filled with deep sadness. 
\p 
\v 24 Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum. There the people who collect the temple tax came to Peter. They asked him, ‘Doesnʼt your teacher pay the temple tax?’ 
\p 
\v 25 ‘Yes, he does,’ he replied. 
\p When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. ‘What do you think, Simon?’ he asked. ‘Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and fees from? Do they collect them from their own children or from others?’ 
\p 
\v 26 ‘From others’, Peter answered. 
\p ‘Then the children donʼt have to pay,’ Jesus said to him. 
\v 27 ‘But we donʼt want to make them angry. So go to the lake and throw out your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the exact coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.’ 
\im  \bd  17:14-27\bd* The disciples were struggling. They had been looking for a messiah who would destroy the Romans. Yet Jesus said that he would be killed. The disciples had seen Jesusʼ power over \k evil spirits\k*\ef -  \fr  17:14-27 \fk  Evil spirits: \ft  Spirits that God created but that turned against him. They work against God. Their power comes from Satan. They can use their power to control people and be inside them. When humans serve these spirits instead of God, they become slaves to sin and death. Evil spirits canʼt be inside of or control people who believe in Jesus and follow him. The Holy Spirit protects Godʼs people from evil spirits. He gives them power to drive out evil spirits like Jesus did. (See \w  devil\w* \xt Matthew 4:1-11\xt*. \w  Demons\w* \xt Matthew 4:18-25\xt*.)  \ef*. So they believed he could make the nation of Israel strong again. They thought he would do this through violent strength and power. But when they tried to act based on this kind of faith, they failed. Jesus was troubled and concerned. He didnʼt want them to do Godʼs work using violent power. He wanted them to completely trust God and depend fully on Godʼs power. God can do anything. Through a fish he provided the money the disciples needed to pay their \k taxes\k*\ef -  \fr  17:14-27 \fk  Taxes: \ft  Money that a government requires people to pay. Those who live under the authority of that government pay this money. The leaders are supposed to use the money to take care of everyone.\ef*. Yet Jesus explained that death was part of how he would serve God and others. The disciples were confused and sad. This was a time of testing for them.

\c 18 
\p 
\v 1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus. They asked him, ‘Then who is the most important person in the kingdom of heaven?’ 
\p 
\v 2 Jesus called a little child over to him. He had the child stand among them. 
\v 3 Jesus said, ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. You need to change and become like little children. If you donʼt, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
\v 4 Anyone who takes the humble position of this child is the most important in the kingdom of heaven. 
\v 5 Anyone who welcomes a little child like this one in my name welcomes me. 
\p 
\v 6 ‘What if someone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? If they do, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea. 
\v 7 How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Things like that must come. But how terrible for the person who causes them! 
\v 8 If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be better to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one hand than go into hell with two hands. It would be better to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one foot than go into hell with two feet. In hell the fire burns for ever. 
\v 9 If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. It would be better to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. 
\p 
\v 10-11 ‘See that you donʼt look down on one of these little ones. Here is what I tell you. Their angels in heaven are always with my Father who is in heaven. 
\im  \bd  18:1-11\bd* This is the beginning of the fourth of Jesusʼ long messages. He talked about what it means to be important. He also talked about forgiving others. In Jesusʼ time, many people didnʼt think children were complete humans yet. But Jesus showed that children are very important. Children have many needs and must trust others to take care of them. Jesus said it is a terrible thing to trick children and cause them to sin. Itʼs terrible to do that to anyone who is humble and trusting.

\ip  Jesus also taught that his disciples must become like little children in Godʼs kingdom. They must stop trying to be considered important. They must be humble and trust Jesus. This is what it means to be like a little one who believes in Jesus. Yet the disciples were also leaders in Godʼs work. They were not to cause children or any of Jesusʼ followers to sin. They were to be careful to teach the truth about God. Jesus was very serious about this and talked about harming the body to avoid sin. He didnʼt mean that people should actually hurt themselves. Jesus was talking in a way that got peopleʼs attention. He wanted them to understand how important it was to follow Godʼs way of life.

\p 
\v 12 ‘What do you think? Suppose a man owns 100 sheep and one of them wanders away. Wonʼt he leave the 99 sheep on the hills? Wonʼt he go and look for the one that wandered off? 
\v 13 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he is happier about the one than about the 99 that didnʼt wander off. 
\v 14 It is the same with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to die. 
\im  \bd  18:12-14\bd* Humans are like sheep that were lost from Godʼs family. God the Father sends his Son into the world to find them. He is full of joy about each one who comes home. God doesnʼt want his little ones to ever be apart from his love and life. 
\p 
\v 15 ‘If your brother or sister sins against you, go to them. Tell them what they did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them back. 
\v 16 But what if they wonʼt listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. Scripture says, “Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses.” (\xt Deuteronomy 19:15\xt*) 
\v 17 But what if they also refuse to listen to the witnesses? Then tell it to the church. And what if they refuse to listen even to the church? Then donʼt treat them as a brother or sister. Treat them as you would treat an ungodly person or a tax collector. 
\p 
\v 18 ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven. 
\p 
\v 19 ‘Again, here is what I tell you. Suppose two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for. My Father in heaven will do it for you. 
\v 20 Where two or three people gather in my name, I am there with them.’ 
\p 
\v 21 Peter came to Jesus. He asked, ‘Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?’ 
\p 
\v 22 Jesus answered, ‘I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times. 
\p 
\v 23 ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money his servants owed him. 
\v 24 As the king began to do it, a man who owed him 10,000 bags of gold was brought to him. 
\v 25 The man was not able to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all he owned had to be sold to pay back what he owed. 
\p 
\v 26 ‘Then the servant fell on his knees in front of him. “Give me time,” he begged. “Iʼll pay everything back.” 
\v 27 His master felt sorry for him. He forgave him what he owed and let him go. 
\p 
\v 28 ‘But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him 100 silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. “Pay back what you owe me!” he said. 
\p 
\v 29 ‘The other servant fell on his knees. “Give me time,” he begged him. “Iʼll pay it back.” 
\p 
\v 30 ‘But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison. The man would be held there until he could pay back what he owed. 
\v 31 The other servants saw what had happened and were very angry. They went and told their master everything that had happened. 
\p 
\v 32 ‘Then the master called the first servant in. “You evil servant,” he said. “I forgave all that you owed me because you begged me to. 
\v 33 Shouldnʼt you have had mercy on the other servant just as I had mercy on you?” 
\v 34 In anger his master handed him over to the jailers. He would be punished until he paid back everything he owed. 
\p 
\v 35 ‘This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.’ 
\im  \bd  18:15-35\bd* Jesus described the kingdom of heaven as Godʼs household. Itʼs full of Godʼs children who are all brothers and sisters. Jesus taught Godʼs children to deal with conflict, pray together and forgive one another. Two people who have a conflict must seek peace together with honesty and humility. If they canʼt reach an agreement, they must ask others for help. People who refuse to stop harming others canʼt stay in Godʼs family unless they change. Jesus promised to be with his followers who pray together, and God will answer them. Then Jesus told a story to answer Peterʼs question about forgiving his brothers and sisters. God is like the king who showed great mercy to the servant and forgave him. But the servant whom the king had forgiven didnʼt show mercy to the other servant. Godʼs children mustnʼt be like that. They show they are grateful for Godʼs mercy when they forgive one another. 
\c 19 
\p 
\v 1 When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the River Jordan. 
\v 2 Large crowds followed him. He healed them there. 
\p 
\v 3 Some Pharisees came to test Jesus. They asked, ‘Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?’ 
\p 
\v 4 Jesus replied, ‘Havenʼt you read that in the beginning the Creator “made them male and female”? (\xt Genesis 1:27\xt*) 
\v 5 He said, “Thatʼs why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two will become one.” (\xt Genesis 2:24\xt*) 
\v 6 They are no longer two, but one. So no one should separate what God has joined together.’ 
\p 
\v 7 They asked, ‘Then why did Moses command that a man can give his wife a letter of divorce and send her away?’ 
\p 
\v 8 Jesus replied, ‘Moses let you divorce your wives because you were stubborn. But it was not this way from the beginning. 
\v 9 Here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him.’ 
\p 
\v 10 Here is what the disciples said to him. ‘If thatʼs the way it is between a husband and wife, it is better not to get married.’ 
\p 
\v 11 Jesus replied, ‘Not everyone can accept the idea of staying single. Only those who have been helped to live without getting married can accept it. 
\v 12 Some men are not able to have children because they were born that way. Some have been made that way by other people. Others have chosen to live that way in order to serve the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.’ 
\p 
\v 13 Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told them not to do it. 
\p 
\v 14 Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me. Donʼt keep them away. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them.’ 
\v 15 Jesus placed his hands on them to bless them. Then he went on from there. 
\im  \bd  19:1-15\bd* The Pharisees were looking for ways to trap Jesus. They asked a question about divorce. The Law of Moses allowed people to get divorced. So they thought God approved of divorce. But Jesus taught them what God wanted for the world when he created it. Two people are made one when they get married. God wants them to always stay as one. They are like a picture of Godʼs faithful love. Then there are other people who God helps to stay single. The important thing is to serve the kingdom of heaven whether married or single. 
\ip  Jesus welcomed some children his disciples were trying to send away. The children werenʼt like the Pharisees who tried to trick Jesus. They simply trusted Jesus and received his blessing. He talked about them to explain the kingdom of heaven. His kingdom is for people who are humble and trust Jesus completely. 
\p 
\v 16 Just then, a man came up to Jesus. He asked, ‘Teacher, what good thing must I do to receive eternal life?’ 
\p 
\v 17 ‘Why do you ask me about what is good?’ Jesus replied. ‘There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments.’ 
\p 
\v 18 ‘Which ones?’ the man asked. 
\p Jesus said, ‘ “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not be a false witness. 
\v 19 Honour your father and mother.” (\xt Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20\xt*) And “love your neighbour as you love yourself.” ’ (\xt Leviticus 19:18\xt*) 
\p 
\v 20 ‘I have obeyed all those commandments,’ the young man said. ‘What else do I need to do?’ 
\p 
\v 21 Jesus answered, ‘If you want to be perfect, go and sell everything you have. Give the money to those who are poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.’ 
\p 
\v 22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich. 
\p 
\v 23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. It is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. 
\v 24 Again I tell you, it is hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it is even harder for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.’ 
\p 
\v 25 When the disciples heard this, they were really amazed. They asked, ‘Then who can be saved?’ 
\p 
\v 26 Jesus looked at them and said, ‘With people, this is impossible. But with God, all things are possible.’ 
\p 
\v 27 Peter answered him, ‘We have left everything to follow you! What reward will be given to us?’ 
\p 
\v 28 ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true,’ Jesus said to them. ‘When all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones. You will judge the 12 tribes of Israel. 
\v 29 Suppose anyone has left houses, brothers or sisters, father or mother, husband or wife, children or fields because of me. Anyone who has done that will receive 100 times as much. They will also receive eternal life. 
\v 30 But many who are first will be last. And many who are last will be first. 
\im  \bd  19:16-30\bd* Being a good person or a rich person doesnʼt make someone part of Godʼs kingdom. Caring about what God cares about allows people to share in Godʼs eternal life. Jesus taught that it can be hard for rich people to care about God. This is because they often trust their money and not God. The disciples were shocked at Jesusʼ teachings and asked him questions. They were slowly realising that being faithful to Jesus was much harder than they thought. Following him meant they would lose things that were important to them on this earth. Yet Jesus promised that they would receive so much more. They would even have the wisdom and authority to judge the tribes of Israel. That will happen after \k judgement day\k*\ef -  \fr  19:16-30 \fk  Judgement day: \ft  The time in the future when God will judge all humans and all spiritual beings. He will show if their thoughts, desires and actions agree with what he wants for his world. He will show if they have followed his ways. He will fully separate evil from good. He will completely destroy for ever all that is evil. All that is good will exist for ever in peace and joy with God.\ef* when God makes \k all things new again\k*\ef -  \fr  19:16-30 \fk  New creation: \ft  The world when Jesus rules fully as King on earth. Itʼs called the new heaven and the new earth. God will destroy everything evil and will make the world new. He will raise his people from the dead and give them new bodies. Jesus started the new creation when he rose from the dead. Those who follow Jesus now on earth live as part of the new creation.\ef*.

\p 
\v 1 ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned land. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 
\v 2 He agreed to give them the usual pay for a dayʼs work. Then he sent them into his vineyard. 
\p 
\v 3 ‘About nine oʼclock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing. 
\v 4 He told them, “You also go and work in my vineyard. Iʼll pay you what is right.” 
\v 5 So they went. 
\p ‘He went out again about noon and at three oʼclock and did the same thing. 
\v 6 About five oʼclock he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, “Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?” 
\p 
\v 7 ‘ “Because no one has hired us,” they answered. 
\p ‘He said to them, “You also go and work in my vineyard.” 
\p 
\v 8 ‘When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the person who was in charge of the workers. He said, “Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones I hired. Then go on to the first ones.” 
\p 
\v 9 ‘The workers who were hired about five oʼclock came. Each received the usual dayʼs pay. 
\v 10 So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual dayʼs pay. 
\v 11 When they received it, they began to complain about the owner. 
\v 12 “These people who were hired last worked only one hour,” they said. “You have paid them the same as us. We have done most of the work and have been in the hot sun all day.” 
\p 
\v 13 ‘The owner answered one of them. “Friend”, he said, “Iʼm being fair to you. Didnʼt you agree to work for the usual dayʼs pay? 
\v 14 Take your money and go. I want to give the one I hired last the same pay I gave you. 
\v 15 Donʼt I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave so freely to the others?” 
\p 
\v 16 ‘So those who are last will be first. And those who are first will be last.’ 
\im  \bd  20:1-16\bd* In Jesusʼ time, workers would stand in the marketplace with their tools waiting to be hired for the day. Even when there wasnʼt enough work, the workers would keep waiting and hoping. They needed to earn money to buy food for that day. Jesus told a story about this to teach his disciples about Godʼs \k grace\k*\ef -  \fr  20:1-16 \fk  Grace: \ft  Godʼs deep love for his creatures and his desire to do good to them. He offers his love because he wants good things for everything he created.\ef*. God is like the owner who paid each worker enough for that dayʼs needs. Those who had been hired early were jealous and angry. They were unhappy that those hired last received the same pay as they did. But the owner wanted to be generous with all of them. This is like God welcoming into his kingdom everyone who comes to him. The disciples were there when Jesus began his work. Others would follow Jesus later. But everyone is considered a full and equal part of Godʼs new family. They all depend on the King and Ruler who gives so freely.

\p 
\v 17 Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took his 12 disciples to one side to talk to them. 
\v 18 ‘We are going up to Jerusalem,’ he said. ‘The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will sentence him to death. 
\v 19 Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles. The people will make fun of him and whip him. They will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!’ 
\p 
\v 20 The mother of Zebedeeʼs sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. Getting on her knees, she asked a favour of him. 
\p 
\v 21 ‘What do you want?’ Jesus asked. 
\p She said, ‘Promise me that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise that the other one may sit at your left hand.’ 
\p 
\v 22 ‘You donʼt know what youʼre asking for,’ Jesus said to them. ‘Can you drink the cup of suffering I am going to drink?’ 
\p ‘We can’, they answered. 
\p 
\v 23 Jesus said to them, ‘You will certainly drink from my cup. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left hand. These places belong to those my Father has prepared them for.’ 
\p 
\v 24 The other ten disciples heard about this. They became angry at the two brothers. 
\v 25 Jesus called them together. He said, ‘You know about the rulers of the Gentiles. They hold power over their people. Their high officials order them around. 
\v 26 Donʼt be like that. Instead, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant. 
\v 27 And anyone who wants to be first must be your slave. 
\v 28 Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served. Instead, he came to serve others. He came to give his life as the price for setting many people free.’ 
\p 
\v 29 Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd followed him. 
\v 30 Two blind men were sitting by the side of the road. They heard that Jesus was going by. So they shouted, ‘Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!’ 
\p 
\v 31 The crowd commanded them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, ‘Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!’ 
\p 
\v 32 Jesus stopped and called out to them. ‘What do you want me to do for you?’ he asked. 
\p 
\v 33 ‘Lord’, they answered, ‘we want to be able to see.’ 
\p 
\v 34 Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Right away they could see. And they followed him. 
\im  \bd  20:17-34\bd* On his way to Jerusalem, Jesus worked hard to change how the disciples thought. He explained again that his work was to serve others. He told them again that he would suffer and die. And then he would be raised from the dead. The disciples still thought that Godʼs kingdom would be like human governments. Jesus invited them to share in a different kind of power. He wanted them to understand what honour and authority really mean in Godʼs kingdom. True authority and honour arenʼt based on the power to rule over others. They arenʼt based on being more important than others. In Godʼs kingdom, power and authority are based on serving others. Jesus then showed his disciples what it meant to serve others. He had deep concern for two blind men and healed them. True power and authority come only from following Jesus the Servant. 
\c 21 
\p 
\v 1 As they all approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage. It was on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent out two disciples. 
\v 2 He said to them, ‘Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you get there, you will find a donkey tied up. Her colt will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me. 
\v 3 If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them right away.’ 
\p 
\v 4 This took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would come true. It says, 
\q1 
\v 5 ‘Say to the city of Zion, 
\q2 “See, your king comes to you. 
\q1 He is gentle and riding on a donkey. 
\q2 He is riding on a donkeyʼs colt.” ’ (\xt Zechariah 9:9\xt*) 
\p 
\v 6 The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do. 
\v 7 They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their coats on them for Jesus to sit on. 
\v 8 A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 
\v 9 Some of the people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted, 
\q1 ‘Hosanna to the Son of David!’ 
\b 
\q1 ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’ (\xt Psalm 118:26\xt*) 
\b 
\q1 ‘Hosanna in the highest heaven!’ 
\p 
\v 10 When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, ‘Who is this?’ 
\p 
\v 11 The crowds answered, ‘This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.’ 
\p 
\v 12 Jesus entered the temple courtyard. He began to drive out all those who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables of the people who were exchanging money. He also turned over the benches of those who were selling doves. 
\v 13 He said to them, ‘It is written that the Lord said, “My house will be called a house where people can pray.” (\xt Isaiah 56:7\xt*) But you are making it “a den for robbers.” ’ (\xt Jeremiah 7:11\xt*) 
\p 
\v 14 Blind people and those who were disabled came to Jesus at the temple. There he healed them. 
\v 15 The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did. They also saw the children in the temple courtyard shouting, ‘Hosanna to the Son of David!’ But when they saw all this, they became angry. 
\p 
\v 16 ‘Do you hear what these children are saying?’ they asked him. 
\p ‘Yes’, replied Jesus. ‘Havenʼt you ever read about it in Scripture? It says, 
\q1 ‘ “Lord, you have made sure that children and infants 
\q2 praise you.” ’ (\xt Psalm 8:2\xt*) 
\p 
\v 17 Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. 
\im  \bd  21:1-17\bd* For the first time in Matthewʼs gospel, Jesus openly acted as Israelʼs King and Messiah. He rode into Jerusalem in victory. But even in victory Jesus was gentle. He rode a donkey and not a war horse. The crowds covered the road with their coats and with palm branches. These were common ways that Jews welcomed people and celebrated victory. The crowds also sang an important song from \xt Psalm 118\xt*. This song was hundreds of years old. Itʼs about how God comes to save his people who are suffering. Singing it about Jesus meant that Jesus was Godʼs answer to his peopleʼs troubles. Jesus accepted being called the Son of David. This was a way of announcing that he is the King. Then with royal authority Jesus entered the temple. The temple wasnʼt being used in a way that honoured God. Many people were using the temple to make money instead of as a place of prayer. Jesus forced them to leave. Jesus made sure that it was once again used as a place of praise and healing.

\p 
\v 18 Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry. 
\v 19 He saw a fig tree by the road. He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, ‘May you never bear fruit again!’ Right away the tree dried up. 
\p 
\v 20 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. ‘How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?’ they asked. 
\p 
\v 21 Jesus replied, ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. And you can say to this mountain, “Go and throw yourself into the sea.” It will be done. 
\v 22 If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray.’ 
\p 
\v 23 Jesus entered the temple courtyard. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. ‘By what authority are you doing these things?’ they asked. ‘Who gave you this authority?’ 
\p 
\v 24 Jesus replied, ‘I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 
\v 25 Where did Johnʼs baptism come from? Was it from heaven? Or did it come from human authority?’ 
\p They talked to one another about it. They said, ‘If we say, “From heaven”, he will ask, “Then why didnʼt you believe him?” 
\v 26 But what if we say, “From human authority”? We are afraid of the people. Everyone believes that John was a prophet.’ 
\p 
\v 27 So they answered Jesus, ‘We donʼt know.’ 
\p Jesus said, ‘Then I wonʼt tell you by what authority I am doing these things either. 
\im  \bd  21:18-27\bd* Going back to Jerusalem the next morning, Jesus was hungry. But the fig tree he saw had no fruit. The tree was a picture of Godʼs people in Jesusʼ time. God wanted them to be like strong and healthy plants that produced a good harvest. But the nation didnʼt bear the fruit of \k good works\k*\ef -  \fr  21:18-27 \fk  Good works: \ft  Things that people do that please God. Believers do them as a result of Godʼs love and grace in their lives. The Holy Spirit gives believers the strength to do good works. When people follow Jesusʼ example of thinking, speaking and acting, they are doing good works. Good works include taking care of Godʼs creation and serving others. Good works bring blessing to others and praise to God.\ef* that God was looking for. Jesus didnʼt want things to stay the way they were in Israel. Over and over again he taught that Israel must turn away from sin. They had to turn toward God and obey him only. The things Jesus taught challenged the teachings of Israelʼs elders. So the leaders challenged Jesus by questioning his authority. But Jesus kept teaching and working.

\p 
\v 28 ‘What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, “Son, go and work today in the vineyard.” 
\p 
\v 29 ‘ “I will not,” the son answered. But later he changed his mind and went. 
\p 
\v 30 ‘Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, “I will, sir.” But he did not go. 
\p 
\v 31 ‘Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?’ 
\p ‘The first’, they answered. 
\p Jesus said to them, ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. Tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you. 
\v 32 John came to show you the right way to live. And you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. You saw this. But even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. 
\p 
\v 33 ‘Listen to another story. A man who owned some land planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it. He dug a pit for a winepress in it. He also built a lookout tower. He rented the vineyard out to some farmers. Then he moved to another place. 
\v 34 When harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the tenants. He told the slaves to collect his share of the fruit. 
\p 
\v 35 ‘But the tenants grabbed his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him. 
\v 36 Then the man sent other slaves to the tenants. He sent more than he did the first time. The tenants treated them the same way. 
\v 37 Last of all, he sent his son to them. “They will respect my son,” he said. 
\p 
\v 38 ‘But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to one another, “This is the one who will receive all the ownerʼs property someday. Come, letʼs kill him. Then everything will be ours.” 
\v 39 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him. 
\p 
\v 40 ‘When the owner of the vineyard comes back, what will he do to those tenants?’ 
\p 
\v 41 ‘He will destroy those evil people,’ they replied. ‘Then he will rent the vineyard out to other tenants. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.’ 
\p 
\v 42 Jesus said to them, ‘Havenʼt you ever read what the Scriptures say, 
\q1 ‘ “The stone the builders didnʼt accept 
\q2 has become the most important stone of all. 
\q1 The Lord has done it. 
\q2 It is wonderful in our eyes”? (\xt Psalm 118:22,23\xt*) 
\p 
\v 43 ‘So here is what I tell you. The kingdom of God will be taken away from you. It will be given to people who will produce its fruit. 
\v 44 Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will crush anyone it falls on.’ 
\p 
\v 45 The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesusʼ stories. They knew he was talking about them. 
\v 46 So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet. 
\im  \bd  21:28-46\bd* Jesus told two stories that talked about Israel as Godʼs vineyard. In the first story, many people who were outsiders and hated by others said yes to Jesus. Tax collectors and prostitutes believed Jesus and obeyed him. Yet Israelʼs leaders were like the second son in the story. They said they would obey God but they didnʼt. 
\ip  In the second story, God cared for his vineyard with great love and attention. So he expected to find good grapes. Jesus was talking about how people should act when they have turned away from sin. The good harvest would be shown in the lives of those who trust God and obey him. But Israelʼs leaders didnʼt share any of the harvest with God. They were the tenants in the story who killed Godʼs servants and his Son. So they couldnʼt stay in the vineyard. When the religious leaders heard this story, they were very angry. 
\ip  Jesus used words from \xt Psalm 118\xt* once again. This part of the psalm is about an important stone. The builders didnʼt want to use it in what they were making. Yet the stone did get used and became the most important one in the building. The Jews were like those builders, and Jesus was like the stone. Godʼs people were refusing to accept him. Yet Jesus would become the most important part of the kingdom God was building. 
\c 22 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus told them more stories. He said, 
\v 2 ‘Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding dinner for his son. 
\v 3 He sent his slaves to those who had been invited to the dinner. The slaves told them to come. But they refused. 
\p 
\v 4 ‘Then he sent some more slaves. He said, “Tell those who were invited that I have prepared my dinner. I have killed my oxen and my fattest cattle. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner.” 
\p 
\v 5 ‘But the people paid no attention. One went away to his field. Another went away to his business. 
\v 6 The rest grabbed his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them. 
\v 7 The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city. 
\p 
\v 8 ‘Then the king said to his slaves, “The wedding dinner is ready. But those I invited were not fit to come. 
\v 9 So go to the street corners. Invite to the dinner anyone you can find.” 
\v 10 So the slaves went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests. 
\p 
\v 11 ‘The king came in to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 
\v 12 “Friend”, he asked, “how did you get in here without wedding clothes?” The man couldnʼt think of anything to say. 
\p 
\v 13 ‘Then the king told his slaves, “Tie up his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. Out there people will weep and grind their teeth.” 
\p 
\v 14 ‘Many are invited, but few are chosen.’ 
\im  \bd  22:1-14\bd* In Jesusʼ time people often spoke about Godʼs coming kingdom like a great feast. Jesus told a story about that. The story was about how God had invited Israel into the kingdom of heaven. But they refused to follow his ways. God sent many prophets to give them warnings. They treated the prophets badly and then wouldnʼt accept the Kingʼs own Son. So other people would be invited into Godʼs kingdom instead. Because of how they disobeyed Israel would face terrible judgement. This happened in \k AD 70\k*\ef -  \fr  22:1-14 \fk  AD: \ft  A way to describe all the years after Jesus was born. In the Latin language, AD means the year of our Lord. AD 70 was the year that Roman armies destroyed the temple. They also destroyed much of the city of Jerusalem. Jewish rebels had been fighting against Romeʼs rule for four years. Under the general Titus, Roman armies killed many Jews and burned the temple. It was never rebuilt. Jesus had warned people many times that this would happen. Jesus described it as punishment for not accepting him as the Messiah sent by God.\ef* when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. But all who follow Godʼs ways will be part of his kingdom. The wedding feast can and must take place!

\p 
\v 15 The Pharisees went out. They made plans to trap Jesus with his own words. 
\v 16 They sent their followers to him. They sent the Herodians with them. ‘Teacher’, they said, ‘we know that you are a man of honour. You teach the way of God truthfully. You donʼt let others tell you what to do or say. You donʼt care how important they are. 
\v 17 Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay the royal tax to Caesar or not?’ 
\p 
\v 18 But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said, ‘You pretenders! Why are you trying to trap me? 
\v 19 Show me the coin people use for paying the tax.’ They brought him a silver coin. 
\v 20 He asked them, ‘Whose picture is this? And whose words?’ 
\p 
\v 21 ‘Caesarʼs,’ they replied. 
\p Then he said to them, ‘So give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give back to God what belongs to God.’ 
\p 
\v 22 When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. 
\p 
\v 23 That same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead. 
\v 24 ‘Teacher’, they said, ‘here is what Moses told us. If a man dies without having children, his brother must get married to the widow. He must provide children to carry on his brotherʼs name. 
\v 25 There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 
\v 26 The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It happened right on down to the seventh brother. 
\v 27 Finally, the woman died. 
\v 28 Now then, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven of them were married to her.’ 
\p 
\v 29 Jesus replied, ‘You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures. And you do not know the power of God. 
\v 30 When the dead rise, they wonʼt get married. And their parents wonʼt give them to be married. They will be like the angels in heaven. 
\v 31 What about the dead rising? Havenʼt you read what God said to you? 
\v 32 He said, “I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. And I am the God of Jacob.” (\xt Exodus 3:6\xt*) He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living.’ 
\p 
\v 33 When the crowds heard this, they were amazed by what he taught. 
\im  \bd  22:15-33\bd* There were several different groups of leaders in Israel during Jesusʼ time. The Pharisees, \k Herodians\k*\ef -  \fr  22:15-33 \fk  Herodians: \ft  Supporters of Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee. The Pharisees hated them. Herod had been given his authority by Rome.\ef* and Sadducees usually disagreed with one another and fought for power. But they all worked together against Jesus. Jesus wasnʼt part of any of Israelʼs groups of leaders. He didnʼt teach the same things that Israelʼs elders had taught for hundreds of years. He spoke fresh and powerful words that showed what Godʼs kingdom is like.

\ip  The Pharisees and Herodians tried to trap Jesus by asking a hard question. Their question was about whether to obey a human government or God. But Jesus didnʼt allow them to trap him. Instead he gave them a wise answer. He said that of course people must obey Caesar. But they must be more faithful to God than to any government. Then the Sadducees tried to trap Jesus with a difficult story. They didnʼt believe that people would rise from the dead. Jesus corrected them. He showed that the resurrection would be nothing like what they were thinking. The bodies people have in the resurrection wonʼt be like the bodies they have now. What really matters is that God is the powerful God of life.

\p 
\v 34 The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees werenʼt able to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees got together. 
\v 35 One of them was an authority on the law. So he tested Jesus with a question. 
\v 36 ‘Teacher’, he asked, ‘which is the most important commandment in the Law?’ 
\p 
\v 37 Jesus replied, ‘ “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind.” (\xt Deuteronomy 6:5\xt*) 
\v 38 This is the first and most important commandment. 
\v 39 And the second is like it. “Love your neighbour as you love yourself.” (\xt Leviticus 19:18\xt*) 
\v 40 Everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments.’ 
\p 
\v 41 The Pharisees were gathered together. Jesus asked them, 
\v 42 ‘What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?’ 
\p ‘The son of David,’ they replied. 
\p 
\v 43 He said to them, ‘Then why does David call him “Lord”? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said, 
\q1 
\v 44 ‘ “The Lord said to my Lord, 
\q2 ‘Sit at my right hand 
\q1 until I put your enemies 
\q2 under your control.’ ” (\xt Psalm 110:1\xt*) 
\m 
\v 45 So if David calls him “Lord”, how can he be Davidʼs son?’ 
\v 46 No one could give any answer to him. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions. 
\im  \bd  22:34-46\bd* The Pharisees tried one last time to argue against Jesus and win. They asked him what the most important commandment was. Jesus gave answers that most Jews in Israel at the time would have agreed with. The first important commandment was to be completely faithful to God and serve only him. The second important commandment was to take care of their neighbours. Then Jesus asked the Pharisees a hard question. How can the Messiah be both Davidʼs son and Davidʼs Lord? This was a mystery about Jesus that Israelʼs leaders never understood. They couldnʼt accept that God had come to earth in a human body. They were confused and didnʼt know how to answer. The leaders stopped trying to trap Jesus with words. 
\c 23 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples. 
\v 2 ‘The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Mosesʼ seat,’ he said. 
\v 3 ‘So you must be careful to do everything they say. But donʼt do what they do. They donʼt practise what they preach. 
\v 4 They tie up heavy loads that are hard to carry. Then they put them on other peopleʼs shoulders. But they themselves arenʼt willing to lift a finger to move them. 
\p 
\v 5 ‘Everything they do is done for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear little boxes that hold Scripture verses. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long. 
\v 6 They love to sit down in the place of honour at dinners. They also love to have the most important seats in the synagogues. 
\v 7 They love to be greeted with respect in the markets. They love it when people call them “Rabbi”. 
\p 
\v 8 ‘But you shouldnʼt be called “Rabbi”. You have only one Teacher, and you are all brothers. 
\v 9 Do not call anyone on earth “father”. You have one Father, and he is in heaven. 
\v 10 You shouldnʼt be called “teacher”. You have one Teacher, and he is the Messiah. 
\v 11 The most important person among you will be your servant. 
\v 12 People who lift themselves up will be made humble. And people who make themselves humble will be lifted up. 
\p 
\v 13-14 ‘How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in peopleʼs faces. You yourselves do not enter. And you will not let those enter who are trying to. 
\p 
\v 15 ‘How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You travel everywhere to win one person to your faith. Then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are. 
\p 
\v 16 ‘How terrible for you, blind guides! You say, “If anyone makes a promise in the name of the temple, it means nothing. But anyone who makes a promise in the name of the gold of the temple must keep that promise.” 
\v 17 You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold holy? 
\v 18 You also say, “If anyone makes a promise in the name of the altar, it means nothing. But anyone who makes a promise in the name of the gift on the altar must keep that promise.” 
\v 19 You are blind! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift holy? 
\v 20 So anyone making a promise in the name of the altar makes a promise in the name of it and everything on it. 
\v 21 And anyone making a promise in the name of the temple makes a promise in the name of it and the one who lives in it. 
\v 22 And anyone making a promise in the name of heaven makes a promise in the name of Godʼs throne and the one who sits on it. 
\p 
\v 23 ‘How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You give God a tenth of your spices, like mint, dill and cummin. But you have not practised the more important things of the law, which are fairness, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practised the last things without failing to do the first. 
\v 24 You blind guides! You remove the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a whole camel! 
\p 
\v 25 ‘How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You clean the outside of a cup and dish. But on the inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves. 
\v 26 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish. Then the outside will also be clean. 
\p 
\v 27 ‘How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You are like tombs that are painted white. They look beautiful on the outside. But on the inside they are full of the bones of the dead. They are also full of other things that are not pure and “clean”. 
\v 28 It is the same with you. On the outside you seem to be doing what is right. But on the inside you are full of what is wrong. You pretend to be what you are not. 
\p 
\v 29 ‘How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You build tombs for the prophets. You decorate the graves of the godly. 
\v 30 And you say, “If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us, we wouldnʼt have done what they did. We wouldnʼt have helped to kill the prophets.” 
\v 31 So you are witnesses against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets. 
\v 32 So go ahead and finish the sins that those who lived before you started! 
\p 
\v 33 ‘You nest of poisonous snakes! How will you escape from being sentenced to hell? 
\v 34 So I am sending you prophets, wise people, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will nail some to a cross. Others you will whip in your synagogues. You will chase them from town to town. 
\v 35 So you will pay for all the godly peopleʼs blood spilled on earth. I mean from the blood of godly Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berekiah. Zechariah was the one you murdered between the temple and the altar. 
\v 36 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are now living. 
\p 
\v 37 ‘Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and throw stones in order to kill those who are sent to you. Many times I have wanted to gather your people together. I have wanted to be like a hen who gathers her chicks under her wings. And you would not let me! 
\v 38 Look, your house is left empty. 
\v 39 I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, “Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.” ’ (\xt Psalm 118:26\xt*) 
\im  \bd  23:1-39\bd* In the last of his long messages, Jesus spoke words of judgement against Israelʼs leaders. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sat in the seat of Moses. This meant they had authority to teach the people like Moses did. But Israelʼs leaders were pretenders. On the outside they looked clean and holy. Yet on the inside they were full of sin and hatred. They cared about looking powerful and important. They didnʼt care about actually helping the people they led. Seven times Jesus warned them how terrible their judgement would be. For Jews, the number \k seven\k*\ef -  \fr  23:1-39 \fk  Seven: \ft  The number used in the Bible to talk about things being complete. It shows that things are finished and perfect.\ef* showed that something was whole and complete. The religious leaders refused to accept Jesus. This made Jesus so sad. He longed to take care of Godʼs people like a hen protects her baby chicks. But the leaders didnʼt want Jesus to share Godʼs tender love with people. 
\c 24 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus left the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came up to him. They wanted to call his attention to the temple buildings. 
\v 2 ‘Do you see all these things?’ Jesus asked. ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. Not one stone here will be left on top of another. Every stone will be thrown down.’ 
\p 
\v 3 Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There the disciples came to him in private. ‘Tell us’, they said. ‘When will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?’ 
\p 
\v 4 Jesus answered, ‘Keep watch! Be careful that no one fools you. 
\v 5 Many will come in my name. They will claim, “I am the Messiah!” They will fool many people. 
\v 6 You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Donʼt be alarmed. Those things must happen. But the end still isnʼt here. 
\v 7 Nation will fight against nation. Kingdom will fight against kingdom. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places. 
\v 8 All these are the beginning of birth-pains. 
\p 
\v 9 ‘Then people will hand you over to be treated badly and killed. All nations will hate you because of me. 
\v 10 At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies. 
\v 11 Many false prophets will appear. They will fool many people. 
\v 12 Because evil will grow, most peopleʼs love will grow cold. 
\v 13 But the one who remains strong in the faith will be saved. 
\v 14 This good news of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come. 
\im  \bd  24:1-14\bd* Jesusʼ disciples were amazed by the greatness of the temple buildings. Jesus replied with a prophecy that shocked them. The temple would be destroyed. Jesus answered the disciplesʼ questions using words from the prophet Isaiah (\xt Isaiah 19:2\xt*). He said that the beginning of these events would be like birth-pains. The troubles Jesus described had to do with Godʼs plan to make the world new again. Before a new baby arrives, there is pain and suffering. It would be like that before Godʼs kingdom comes. Much of the suffering Jesus described happened right after he was raised from the dead. It happened to his followers in the years AD 30 to 70. They were treated badly as they preached the good news of Jesusʼ kingdom. The book of Acts talks about this.

\p 
\v 15 ‘The prophet Daniel spoke about “the hated thing that destroys.” (\xt Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11\xt*) Someday you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader should understand this. 
\v 16 Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains. 
\v 17 No one on the housetop should go down into the house to take anything out. 
\v 18 No one in the field should go back to get their coat. 
\v 19 How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women! How awful for nursing mothers! 
\v 20 Pray that you will not have to escape in winter or on the Sabbath day. 
\v 21 There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than any other from the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.

\v 22 ‘If the time had not been cut short, no one would live. But because of Godʼs chosen people, it will be shortened. 
\v 23 At that time someone may say to you, “Look! Here is the Messiah!” Or, “There he is!” Do not believe it.

\v 49 Suppose he begins to beat the other slaves. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink too much. 
\v 50 The master of that slave will come back on a day the slave doesnʼt expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know. 
\v 51 Then the master will cut him to pieces. He will send him to the place where pretenders go. There people will weep and grind their teeth. 
\im  \bd  24:15-51\bd* Jesus said the troubles in Israel would happen while his disciples were still alive. His words came true in the years AD 66 to AD 70. The Jews joined together to fight Rome in what was called the Great Revolt. Their fight was crushed by the Roman government. The Romans captured Jerusalem, misused the temple and then destroyed it. Jesus used words from the prophet \k Daniel\k*\ef -  \fr  24:15-51 \fk  Daniel: \ft  A prophet during the time when Babylonia destroyed Jerusalem. As a young man he was taken from Judah to live in Babylon. He served several Babylonian and Persian kings as a wise man and government leader. He was also called Belteshazzar.\ef* to talk about himself (\xt Daniel 7:13\xt*). Jesus is the Son of Man who won the victory and will save his people. But Jesus didnʼt win the victory over Rome. That was the victory the Jews had hoped for and expected from their messiah. Instead, he won the much more important victory over sin and death. No one but God knows exactly when Jesus will come back. Only God knows the day that everyone will see that Jesus is the true King. Jesus didnʼt want his followers to be surprised by it or worried about missing it. His faithful followers can live every day with hope knowing that King Jesus will return.

\v 1 ‘Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went out to meet the groom. 
\v 2 Five of them were foolish. Five were wise. 
\v 3 The foolish ones took their lamps but didnʼt take any olive oil with them. 
\v 4 The wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps. 
\v 5 The groom did not come for a long time. So the bridesmaids all grew tired and fell asleep. 
\p 
\v 6 ‘At midnight someone cried out, “Hereʼs the groom! Come out to meet him!”

\v 12 ‘But he replied, “What Iʼm about to tell you is true. I donʼt know you.” 
\p 
\v 13 ‘So keep watch. You do not know the day or the hour that the groom will come. 
\im  \bd  25:1-13\bd* Jesus told a story about a wedding dinner. It was common for Jews to describe the coming of Godʼs kingdom as a feast. That was when God would rule as King. The wedding dinner in the parable was a feast in King Jesusʼ honour. In the story, five bridesmaids were ready when the groom came. Five others werenʼt ready when the groom arrived. The Messiah was urging his people to be ready for that important moment.

\v 14 ‘Again, here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like. A man was going on a journey. He sent for his slaves and put them in charge of his money. 
\v 15 He gave five bags of gold to one. He gave two bags to another. And he gave one bag to the third. The man gave each slave the amount of money he knew the slave could take care of. Then he went on his journey. 
\v 16 The slave who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work. He earned five bags more. 
\v 17 The one with the two bags of gold earned two more. 
\v 18 But the man who had received one bag went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his masterʼs money in it. 
\p 
\v 19 ‘After a long time the master of those slaves returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned. 
\v 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. “Master”, he said, “you trusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have earned five more.” 
\p 
\v 21 ‘His master replied, “You have done well, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your masterʼs happiness!” 
\p 
\v 22 ‘The man with two bags of gold also came. “Master”, he said, “you trusted me with two bags of gold. See, I have earned two more.” 
\p 
\v 23 ‘His master replied, “You have done well, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your masterʼs happiness!”

\v 25 So I was afraid. I went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.” 
\p 
\v 26 ‘His master replied, “You evil, lazy slave! So you knew that I harvest where I have not planted? You knew that I gather crops where I have not scattered seed? 
\v 27 Well then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have received it back with interest.” 
\p 
\v 28 ‘Then his master commanded the other slaves, “Take the bag of gold from him. Give it to the one who has ten bags. 
\v 29 Everyone who has will be given more. They will have more than enough. And what about anyone who doesnʼt have? Even what they have will be taken away from them. 
\v 30 Throw that worthless slave outside. There in the darkness, people will weep and grind their teeth.” 
\im  \bd  25:14-30\bd* God gives everyone gifts to use to serve him and others. He had given his people Israel the special gifts of his covenants and the Messiah. Yet Godʼs people hadnʼt been faithful to the covenants. And they didnʼt accept Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus told a story to show how dangerous this was for Israel. In the parable, two \k slaves\k*\ef -  \fr  25:14-30 \fk  Slaves and slavery: \ft  Large numbers of people worked as slaves in the lands controlled by the Roman government. The Roman way of life depended on the work done by slaves. Slaves could do nearly every job in a household. Many slaves did work that was hard and difficult. Some became doctors or managed their masterʼs money. As the good news about Jesus spread, many slaves and slave masters believed in Jesus. New Testament writers showed how the relationships between slaves and masters had to change. They showed how the good news doesnʼt allow for one human being to own another. Slaves and free people are accepted and loved by God equally. They are made one in Godʼs family by believing in Jesus. They are all servants of King Jesus. So both slaves and masters were to honour God in how they treated each other. New Testament writers didnʼt teach people to have slaves. They taught how slaves and masters were to treat one another after believing in Jesus.\ef* used their gifts wisely, and they were rewarded. The third slave did nothing with his gift. This slave is like those who refused to trust Godʼs own Son. This meant they were choosing not to be part of Godʼs family. 
\p 
\v 31 ‘The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit in glory on his throne. 
\v 32 All the nations will be gathered in front of him. He will separate the people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats. 
\v 33 He will put the sheep to his right and the goats to his left. 
\p 
\v 34 ‘Then the King will speak to those on his right. He will say, “My Father has blessed you. Come and take what is yours. It is the kingdom prepared for you since the world was created. 
\v 35 I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in. 
\v 36 I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was ill. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.” 
\p 
\v 37 ‘Then the people who have done what is right will answer him. “Lord”, they will ask, “when did we see you hungry and feed you? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink? 
\v 38 When did we see you as a stranger and invite you in? When did we see you needing clothes and give them to you? 
\v 39 When did we see you ill or in prison and go to visit you?” 
\p 
\v 40 ‘The King will reply, “What Iʼm about to tell you is true. Anything you did for one of the least important of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” 
\p 
\v 41 ‘Then he will say to those on his left, “You are cursed! Go away from me into the fire that burns for ever. It has been prepared for the devil and his angels. 
\v 42 I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink. 
\v 43 I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was ill and in prison. But you did not take care of me.” 
\p 
\v 44 ‘They also will answer, “Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you as a stranger or needing clothes or ill or in prison and not help you?” 
\p 
\v 45 ‘He will reply, “What Iʼm about to tell you is true. Anything you didnʼt do for one of the least important of these, you didnʼt do for me.” 
\p 
\v 46 ‘Then they will go away to be punished for ever. But those who have done what is right will receive eternal life.’ 
\im  \bd  25:31-46\bd* The last part of Jesusʼ long message was about Godʼs new family. Those who follow Jesus are his brothers and sisters. All together his followers are like the body of the Messiah on earth. What happens to them also happens to Jesus. This is a wonderful mystery. The new community of people who follow Jesus must be servants. As they take care of others, they are actually serving Jesus. Jesus talked about himself as the Son of Man who was also the glorious King. One day he will separate everything evil from everything good. He will judge the world for the way they treat his brothers and sisters. Only Jesus is wise enough to be the Judge of everything God made.

\c 26 
\p 
\v 1 Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples, 
\v 2 ‘As you know, the Passover Feast is two days away. The Son of Man will be handed over to be nailed to a cross.’ 
\p 
\v 3 Then the chief priests met with the elders of the people. They met in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest. 
\v 4 They made plans to arrest Jesus secretly. They wanted to kill him. 
\v 5 ‘But not during the feast,’ they said. ‘The people may stir up trouble.’ 
\p 
\v 6 Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the home of Simon, who had a skin disease. 
\v 7 A woman came to Jesus with a special sealed jar of very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was at the table. 
\p 
\v 8 When the disciples saw this, they became angry. ‘Why this waste?’ they asked. 
\v 9 ‘The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to poor people.’ 
\p 
\v 10 Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, ‘Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 
\v 11 You will always have poor people with you. But you will not always have me. 
\v 12 She poured the perfume on my body to prepare me to be buried. 
\v 13 What Iʼm about to tell you is true. What she has done will be told anywhere this good news is preached all over the world. It will be told in memory of her.’ 
\p 
\v 14 One of the 12 disciples went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot. 
\v 15 He asked, ‘What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?’ So they counted out 30 silver coins for him. 
\v 16 From then on, Judas watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them. 
\im  \bd  26:1-16\bd* Jesus knew that one of his disciples would turn against him. He knew that Israelʼs leaders would use violence against him. When the woman poured perfume on Jesusʼ head, he knew it wasnʼt a waste. The disciples thought it was, and they were angry. But the woman was helping Jesus prepare to be buried. This sounded like very bad news. But Jesus knew it would lead to good news that would spread everywhere on earth.

\p 
\v 17 It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus. They asked, ‘Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?’ 
\p 
\v 18 He replied, ‘Go into the city to a certain man. Tell him, “The Teacher says, ‘My time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover at your house with my disciples.’ ” ’ 
\v 19 So the disciples did what Jesus had told them to do. They prepared the Passover meal. 
\p 
\v 20 When evening came, Jesus was at the table with his 12 disciples. 
\v 21 While they were eating, he said, ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies.’ 
\p 
\v 22 The disciples became very sad. One after the other, they began to say to him, ‘Surely you donʼt mean me, Lord, do you?’ 
\p 
\v 23 Jesus replied, ‘The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will hand me over. 
\v 24 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But how terrible it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.’ 
\p 
\v 25 Judas was the one who was going to hand him over. He said, ‘Surely you donʼt mean me, Teacher, do you?’ 
\p Jesus answered, ‘You have said so.’ 
\p 
\v 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said, ‘Take this and eat it. This is my body.’ 
\p 
\v 27 Then he took a cup. He gave thanks and handed it to them. He said, ‘All of you drink from it. 
\v 28 This is my blood of the covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many people. 
\v 29 Here is what I tell you. From now on, I wonʼt drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Fatherʼs kingdom.’ 
\p 
\v 30 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. 
\im  \bd  26:17-30\bd* The \k Passover Feast\k*\ef -  \fr  26:17-30 \fk  Passover Feast: \ft  The special meal when Jews celebrate how God saved them from being slaves in Egypt. The first Passover happened right before the exodus. Many years later, Jesus was killed at the time of the Passover Feast.\ef* was a powerful reminder of Godʼs covenant with his people Israel in the Old Testament. God was about to establish a \k new covenant\k*\ef -  \fr  26:17-30 \fk  New covenant: \ft  The set of promises God made when he invited all people to be in his family. God had first announced the new covenant through the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Then Jesus announced it and New Testament writers talked about it. Jesus is the Messiah God promised to send in the old covenant. Jesus gave up his life as a sacrifice to save people from sin and death. Then he was raised from the dead. This established the new covenant. All who trust Jesus to save them are part of his people. They are made right with God. This happens in peopleʼs hearts and changes the way they think and act. They are to follow Jesusʼ way of living. The Holy Spirit makes them able to do this.\ef* through the death and resurrection of Jesus. Jesus was showing his disciples the purpose for his death. Everyone who believed in Jesus would be set free from sin and death. Jesus used signs like bread and wine to teach about this new freedom. He would give up his body like the bread he served the disciples at dinner. Like the wine he poured, blood would flow out of him as he was killed. This is how he would accomplish the work God sent him to do. Itʼs how he would bring the whole world life that can never be destroyed. Through Jesus, God was making a new covenant with all people.

\p 
\v 31 Jesus told them, ‘This very night you will all turn away because of me. It is written that the Lord said, 
\q1 ‘ “I will strike the shepherd down. 
\q2 Then the sheep of the flock will be scattered.” (\xt Zechariah 13:7\xt*) 
\m 
\v 32 But after I rise from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’ 
\p 
\v 33 Peter replied, ‘All the others may turn away because of you. But I never will.’ 
\p 
\v 34 ‘What Iʼm about to tell you is true,’ Jesus answered. ‘It will happen tonight. Before the cockerel crows, you will say three times that you donʼt know me.’ 
\p 
\v 35 But Peter said, ‘I may have to die with you. But I will never say I donʼt know you.’ And all the other disciples said the same thing. 
\p 
\v 36 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, ‘Sit here while I go over there and pray.’ 
\v 37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him. He began to be sad and troubled. 
\v 38 Then he said to them, ‘My soul is very sad. I feel close to death. Stay here. Keep watch with me.’ 
\p 
\v 39 He went a little further. Then he fell with his face to the ground. He prayed, ‘My Father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But let what you want be done, not what I want.’ 
\p 
\v 40 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. ‘Couldnʼt you men keep watch with me for one hour?’ he asked Peter. 
\v 41 ‘Watch and pray. Then you wonʼt fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.’ 
\p 
\v 42 Jesus went away a second time. He prayed, ‘My Father, is it possible for this cup to be taken away? But if I must drink it, may what you want be done.’ 
\p 
\v 43 Then he came back. Again he found them sleeping. They couldnʼt keep their eyes open. 
\v 44 So he left them and went away once more. For the third time he prayed the same thing. 
\p 
\v 45 Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, ‘Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour has come. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners. 
\v 46 Get up! Let us go! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them!’ 
\im  \bd  26:31-46\bd* Jesus was deeply sad and troubled. He was about to do the hardest part of his work to free Godʼs people. He would have to face his hardest battle against evil without his disciples. They would all run away. With great honesty he turned to his Father in prayer. He had hoped his disciples would pray with him, but they fell asleep. His Father had given him strength throughout the time that he had been working. Jesus prayed that what God wanted to happen would be done on earth. 
\p 
\v 47 While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the 12 disciples. A large crowd was with him. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them. 
\v 48 Judas, who was going to hand Jesus over, had arranged a signal with them. ‘The one I kiss is the man,’ he said. ‘Arrest him.’ 
\v 49 So Judas went to Jesus at once. He said, ‘Greetings, Rabbi!’ And he kissed him. 
\p 
\v 50 Jesus replied, ‘Friend, do what you came to do.’ 
\p Then the men stepped forward. They grabbed Jesus and arrested him. 
\v 51 At that moment, one of Jesusʼ companions reached for his sword. He pulled it out and struck the slave of the high priest with it. He cut off the slaveʼs ear. 
\p 
\v 52 ‘Put your sword back in its place,’ Jesus said to him. ‘All who use the sword will die by the sword. 
\v 53 Do you think I canʼt ask my Father for help? He would send an army of more than 70,000 angels right away. 
\v 54 But then how would the Scriptures come true? They say it must happen in this way.’ 
\p 
\v 55 At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. ‘Am I leading a band of armed men against you?’ he asked. ‘Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courtyard teaching. And you didnʼt arrest me. 
\v 56 But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets would come true.’ Then all the disciples left him and ran away. 
\im  \bd  26:47-56\bd* Jesusʼ disciple \k Judas\k*\ef -  \fr  26:47-56 \fk  Judas Iscariot: \ft  One of Jesusʼ 12 disciples. He was in charge of the disciplesʼ money but stole from it. He handed Jesus over to the Jewish leaders who wanted to kill him. Later he killed himself.\ef*\w  Iscariot\w* turned against him. Judas handed Jesus over to people who wanted to harm him. One of Jesusʼ disciples tried to defend him with a sword. But Jesus remained calm and healed the person who got hurt. He refused to use violence against humans. He explained that he could have stopped what was happening. But instead he allowed himself to be arrested. Jesus was committed to obeying God and doing the work God gave him to do. His work wasnʼt to fight humans but to save them from evil.

\p 
\v 57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers of the law and the elders had come together there. 
\v 58 Not too far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen. 
\p 
\v 59 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death. 
\v 60 But they did not find any proof, even though many false witnesses came forward. 
\p Finally, two other witnesses came forward. 
\v 61 They said, ‘This fellow claimed, “I am able to destroy the temple of God. I can build it again in three days.” ’ 
\p 
\v 62 Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, ‘Arenʼt you going to answer? What are these charges that these men are bringing against you?’ 
\v 63 But Jesus remained silent. 
\p The high priest said to him, ‘I am commanding you in the name of the living God. May he judge you if you donʼt tell the truth. Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.’ 
\p 
\v 64 ‘You have said so,’ Jesus replied. ‘But here is what I say to all of you. From now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.’ 
\p 
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his clothes. He said, ‘He has spoken a very evil thing against God! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard him say this evil thing. 
\v 66 What do you think?’ 
\p ‘He must die!’ they answered. 
\p 
\v 67 Then they spat in his face. They hit him with their fists. Others slapped him. 
\v 68 They said, ‘Prophesy to us, Messiah! Who hit you?’ 
\im  \bd  26:57-68\bd* Roman law didnʼt allow the Jewish religious leaders to put people to death. So they wanted the Romans to sentence Jesus to death for being a rebel warrior. Most Jews expected the messiah to fight against the government. But Jesus was fighting the spiritual powers of evil. Jesus didnʼt argue with the leaders or say that he wasnʼt the Messiah. Instead, Jesus spoke about what would happen after he had made his \k sacrifice.\k*\ef -  \fr  26:57-68 \fk  Sacrifice: \ft  An offering given to God. In the New Testament, Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice. He gave up his life to pay for the sins of all people. His sacrifice makes people who believe in him right with God. His followers show they are thankful for his sacrifice by giving up many things. As they continue Jesusʼ work on earth, they give up money and things they own. They give up things they hope to do or to have. They may give up their lives. They offer these things to God because they are full of his love.

Many of these laws came from the Law of Moses. Jewish religious leaders also added laws and rules to those earlier laws. Some of these extra laws and rules helped people obey the Law of Moses. Others made life very difficult for Jews. Certain religious leaders used the laws to control what people did. They also used them to make themselves look better. They did this to make it appear that God favoured them over other people. (See \w  Law\w* or \w  Law of Mosses\w* \xt Matthew 5:13-21\xt*.)\ef* (\xt Deuteronomy 13:1-5\xt*).

\v 69 Peter was sitting out in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. ‘You also were with Jesus of Galilee,’ she said. 
\p 
\v 70 But in front of all of them, Peter said he was not. ‘I donʼt know what youʼre talking about,’ he said. 
\p 
\v 71 Then he went out to the gate leading into the courtyard. There another servant saw him. She said to the people, ‘This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.’ 
\p 
\v 72 Again he said he was not. With a curse he said, ‘I donʼt know the man!’ 
\p 
\v 73 After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter. ‘You must be one of them,’ they said. ‘The way you talk gives you away.’ 
\p 
\v 74 Then Peter began to curse and said to them, ‘I donʼt know the man!’ 
\p Right away a cockerel crowed. 
\v 75 Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said. ‘The cockerel will crow,’ Jesus had told him. ‘Before it does, you will say three times that you donʼt know me.’ Peter went outside. He broke down and cried. 
\im  \bd  26:69-75\bd* Peter had boldly promised to always be faithful to Jesus. But when he found himself in danger, three times he said he didnʼt know Jesus. Peter was filled with terrible sadness when he realised what he had done. Jesus knew Peter, and he knew Peterʼs weaknesses. Jesus had come to rescue even Peter. Jesus still loved Peter. Later he would welcome Peter back into the community of disciples. 
\c 27 
\p 
\v 1 It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and the elders of the people planned how to put Jesus to death. 
\v 2 So they tied him up and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, who was the governor. 
\p 
\v 3 Judas, who had handed him over, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to die. He felt deep shame and sadness for what he had done. So he returned the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. 
\v 4 ‘I have sinned,’ he said. ‘I handed over a man who is not guilty.’ 
\p ‘What do we care?’ they replied. ‘Thatʼs your problem.’ 
\p 
\v 5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. 
\p 
\v 6 The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, ‘Itʼs against the law to put this money into the temple fund. It is blood money. It has paid for a manʼs death.’ 
\v 7 So they decided to use the money to buy a potterʼs field. People from other countries would be buried there. 
\v 8 That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
\v 9 Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true. He had said, ‘They took the 30 silver coins. That price was set for him by the people of Israel. 
\v 10 They used the coins to buy a potterʼs field, just as the Lord commanded me.’ (\xt Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9\xt*) 
\im  \bd  27:1-10\bd* Peter lied about knowing Jesus, and Judas turned Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus later forgave Peter and helped him to be one of the disciples again. This was different from what happened with Judas. Judas had received money for turning against Jesus. Long ago the prophets \k Zechariah\k*\ef -  \fr  27:1-10 \fk  Zechariah: \ft  A priest and prophet after the Jews came back from Babylonia to their homeland. His visions and prophecies are recorded in the book of Zechariah. This was a different Zechariah to the father of John the Baptist.\ef* and \k Jeremiah\k*\ef -  \fr  27:1-10 \fk  Jeremiah: \ft  A prophet during the rule of the last few kings of Judah. He prophesied before Babylonian armies destroyed Jerusalem and for a time after that. His prophecies are recorded in the book of Jeremiah.\ef* had talked about those 30 silver coins. After he handed Jesus over, Judas didnʼt want the money anymore. He realised that he had helped put someone to death who wasnʼt guilty. He felt shame and sadness. But he didnʼt allow himself to be forgiven or brought back into the community. Instead, Judas hung himself. 
\p 
\v 11 Jesus was standing in front of the governor. The governor asked him, ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ 
\p ‘Yes. You have said so,’ Jesus replied. 
\p 
\v 12 But when the chief priests and the elders brought charges against him, he did not answer. 
\v 13 Then Pilate asked him, ‘Donʼt you hear the charges they are bringing against you?’ 
\v 14 But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was really amazed. 
\p 
\v 15 It was the governorʼs practice at the Passover Feast to let one prisoner go free. The people could choose the one they wanted. 
\v 16 At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas. 
\v 17 So when the crowd gathered, Pilate asked them, ‘Which one do you want me to set free? Jesus Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called the Messiah?’ 
\v 18 Pilate knew that the leaders wanted to get their own way. He knew this was why they had handed Jesus over to him. 
\p 
\v 19 While Pilate was sitting on the judgeʼs seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, ‘Donʼt have anything to do with that man. He is not guilty. I have suffered a great deal in a dream today because of him.’ 
\p 
\v 20 But the chief priests and the elders talked the crowd into asking for Barabbas and having Jesus put to death. 
\p 
\v 21 ‘Which of the two do you want me to set free?’ asked the governor. 
\p ‘Barabbas’, they answered. 
\p 
\v 22 ‘Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?’ Pilate asked. 
\p They all answered, ‘Crucify him!’ 
\p 
\v 23 ‘Why? What wrong has he done?’ asked Pilate. 
\p But they shouted even louder, ‘Crucify him!’ 
\p 
\v 24 Pilate saw that he wasnʼt getting anywhere. Instead, the crowd was starting to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. ‘I am not guilty of this manʼs death,’ he said. ‘You are accountable for that!’ 
\p 
\v 25 All the people answered, ‘Put the blame for his death on us and our children!’ 
\p 
\v 26 Pilate let Barabbas go free. But he had Jesus whipped. Then he handed him over to be nailed to a cross. 
\im  \bd  27:11-26\bd* \k Pilate\k*\ef -  \fr  27:11-26 \fk  Pilate: \ft  The Roman governor of Judea who allowed Jesus to be put to death.\ef* wanted to know if Jesus was a king. Would Jesus lead the Jewish people to attack the Roman government? Pilate quickly understood that Jesus wasnʼt dangerous or violent. But he had to stay in control of the crowd and avoid a fight during Passover. So Pilate did what he knew was wrong. Jesus wasnʼt guilty of anything, but Pilate sentenced him to be nailed to a cross. Pilate washed his hands as a sign that he wasnʼt guilty of Jesusʼ death. Yet the water couldnʼt wash away his guilt. The Jewish leaders were guilty. The shouting crowd was also guilty. Jesus would die because of the wrong things that others had done.

\p 
\v 27 The governorʼs soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him. 
\v 28 They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him. 
\v 29 Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown. They placed it on his head. They put a stick in his right hand. Then they fell on their knees in front of him and made fun of him. ‘We honour you, king of the Jews!’ they said. 
\v 30 They spat on him. They hit him on the head with the stick again and again. 
\v 31 After they had made fun of him, they took off the robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to nail him to a cross. 
\p 
\v 32 On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross. 
\v 33 They came to a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means the Place of the Skull. 
\v 34 There they mixed wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it. 
\v 35 When they had nailed him to the cross, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. 
\v 36 They sat down and kept watch over him there. 
\v 37 Above his head they placed the written charge against him. It read, 
\pc This is Jesus, the King of the Jews. 
\p 
\v 38 Two rebels against Rome were crucified with him. One was on his right and one was on his left. 
\v 39 Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and made fun of him. They shook their heads 
\v 40 and said, ‘So you are going to destroy the temple and build it again in three days? Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!’ 
\v 41 In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders made fun of him. 
\v 42 ‘He saved others,’ they said. ‘But he canʼt save himself! Heʼs the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross! Then we will believe in him. 
\v 43 He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him. Heʼs the one who said, “I am the Son of God.” ’ 
\v 44 In the same way the rebels who were being crucified with Jesus also made fun of him. 
\im  \bd  27:27-44\bd* Many people made fun of Jesus as he was dying. The Roman soldiers made mean jokes about whether Jesus was really a king. People passing by laughed at him for not being able to save himself from death. Israelʼs leaders and the criminals beside him also laughed at him. They thought that a real messiah would save the people and himself. A real messiah wouldnʼt lose the battle and die. Yet the sign above Jesusʼ head and the crown were in fact true. He was Israelʼs King who was fighting evil as he died. He was winning the battle through the power of love.

\p 
\v 45 From noon until three oʼclock, the whole land was covered with darkness. 
\v 46 About three oʼclock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, ‘\tl Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\tl*’ This means ‘My God, my God, why have you deserted me?’ (\xt Psalm 22:1\xt*) 
\p 
\v 47 Some of those standing there heard Jesus cry out. They said, ‘Heʼs calling for Elijah.’ 
\p 
\v 48 Right away one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink. 
\v 49 The rest said, ‘Leave him alone. Letʼs see if Elijah comes to save him.’ 
\p 
\v 50 After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, he died. 
\p 
\v 51 At that moment the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split. 
\v 52 Tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. 
\v 53 They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people. 
\p 
\v 54 The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were terrified. They exclaimed, ‘He was surely the Son of God!’ 
\p 
\v 55 Not very far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs. 
\v 56 Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. So was the mother of Zebedeeʼs sons. 
\p 
\v 57 As evening approached, a rich man came from the town of Arimathea. His name was Joseph. He had become a follower of Jesus. 
\v 58 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesusʼ body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him. 
\v 59 Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. 
\v 60 He placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away. 
\v 61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. 
\p 
\v 62 The next day was the day after Preparation Day. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. 
\v 63 ‘Sir’, they said, ‘we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, “After three days I will rise again.” 
\v 64 So give the order to make the tomb secure until the third day. If you donʼt, his disciples might come and steal the body. Then they will tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first.’ 
\p 
\v 65 ‘Take some guards with you,’ Pilate answered. ‘Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can.’ 
\v 66 So they went and made the tomb secure. They put a royal seal on the stone and placed some guards on duty. 
\im  \bd  27:45-66\bd* When Jesus died, he broke the control that sin and death had over Godʼs world. As a sign of this the earth shook, split and broke open. Tombs opened up and some people were even raised from the dead. It was the beginning of something completely new. But Jesusʼ body had no more life in it. His body was taken down from the cross. \k Joseph of Arimathea\k*\ef -  \fr  27:45-66 \fk  Joseph of Arimathea: \ft  A wealthy leader of the Jewish Council from the town of Arimathea. He followed Jesus in secret. This is a different Joseph to the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus.\ef* took care of Jesusʼ dead body and put it in his own tomb. The tomb was secured by guards and a big stone.

\c 28 
\p 
\v 1 The Sabbath day was now over. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. 
\p 
\v 2 There was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and sat on it. 
\v 3 His body shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow. 
\v 4 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. 
\p 
\v 5 The angel said to the women, ‘Donʼt be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
\v 6 He is not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying. 
\v 7 Go quickly! Tell his disciples, “He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.” Now I have told you.’ 
\p 
\v 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples. 
\v 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. ‘Greetings!’ he said. They came to him, took hold of his feet and worshipped him. 
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, ‘Donʼt be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me.’ 
\im  \bd  28:1-10\bd* \k Mary Magdalene\k*\ef -  \fr  28:1-10 \fk  Mary Magdalene: \ft  A woman who was a faithful follower of Jesus. She was probably from the town of Magdala in Galilee. Jesus drove seven demons out of her.\ef* and another woman named Mary went to the tomb to honour Jesus. An angel told them Jesus wasnʼt there because he had risen from the dead. The women became the first witnesses of Jesusʼ resurrection. Jesus had won the battle over death! He was raised to new life. Sin and death were Godʼs enemies. Through Jesusʼ death God won the victory over them. The women were afraid but also filled with joy. When they met Jesus, they worshipped him at once.

\p 
\v 11 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city. They reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 
\v 12 When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large amount of money. 
\v 13 They told the soldiers, ‘We want you to say, “His disciples came during the night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.” 
\v 14 If the governor hears this report, we will pay him off. That will keep you out of trouble.’ 
\v 15 So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has spread all around among the Jews to this day. 
\im  \bd  28:11-15\bd* The religious leaders heard from the guards at Jesusʼ tomb about what happened. They paid the guards to lie about it. Jesus had said many times that he would rise from the dead. The religious leaders didnʼt want anyone to believe that Jesus had been telling the truth.

\p 
\v 16 Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 
\v 17 When they saw him, they worshipped him. But some still had their doubts. 
\v 18 Then Jesus came to them. He said, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
\v 19 So you must go and make disciples of all nations. Baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. 
\v 20 Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And you can be sure that I am always with you, to the very end.’ 
\im  \bd  28:16-20\bd* The disciples saw Jesus and worshipped him on a mountain in Galilee. His final words were about his authority and how the disciples must continue his work. He has authority over the whole world and has brought Godʼs rule to earth. In the Gospel of Matthew Jesus was called \k Immanuel\k*\ef -  \fr  28:16-20 \fk  Immanuel: \ft  A name in the Hebrew language that means God with us. In the time of King Ahaz, Isaiah prophesied about a boy named Immanuel. He would be a sign that God was with the kingdom of Judah. This child was a sign that Judahʼs enemies would be destroyed. (\xt Isaiah 7:14-16\xt*.) Isaiahʼs prophecy also had a meaning for the future. Matthew wrote about this in his gospel. Through Jesus, God was with his people in a human body. Jesus is the Immanuel who saves Godʼs people from sin and death.\ef* when he was born (\xt Matthew 1:23\xt*). That name means God with us. Jesus promised his disciples that he would always be with them. Jesus told them to keep doing the work that he did on earth. They must invite people everywhere into Godʼs family. The victory of Jesus the Messiah must be announced to all nations. All people are called to obey the new King.
