\p \k 1,000 years\k*\im In a vision, John saw that the devil was locked in the Abyss for 1,000 years. John also saw that Christ ruled for 1,000 years. Some of his followers who had been put to death ruled with him. Some people believe that these things will happen exactly as John saw them in the vision. Others believe that these things are signs. They are signs of how God will bring judgement against evil and bring his kingdom to earth.
\p \k 12 judges\k*\im 12 leaders were called judges in the book of \xt Judges\xt*. Their work included more than the work of judges who made decisions about laws. They were military leaders who fought against Israel’s enemies. God used them to rescue his people from being treated badly. These leaders served in different areas of Israel and among different tribes after Joshua died. They didn’t lead all 12 tribes at once. These 12 leaders were Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Deborah, Gideon, Tola, Jair, Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon and Samson. Other leaders like Samuel also served as judges in this way.
\p \k 12 tribes\k*\im Jacob had 12 sons. The families of Jacob’s sons and grandsons became very large tribes. These 12 family groups made up the nation of Israel.

\p \k 144,000\k*\im This number was 12 x 12,000. It was a way to talk about the entire people of God. They were from all times and places and there were too many to count. It didn’t mean exactly 144,000 people from Abraham’s family line. It meant the complete number of those who trust in Jesus.
\p \k 24 elders\k*\im Beings that John saw in a vision of heaven. It’s thought that they are a sign. The number 24 may mean the 12 tribes of Israel together with the 12 apostles.

\p \k 40 days\k*\im A way that writers of the Bible described when something spiritually important happened. This could be a spiritual challenge. It could be a time of being close to God or meeting with God. It could be a time of turning away from sin and having stronger faith in God.

The number was a sign that what happened was important.
\p \k 42 months\k*\im This is three and a half years. It’s half of seven years. In the Bible, seven is the number for things being complete. In Revelation, John saw certain things happen for half of seven years. This meant that those things weren’t complete.

\p \k Adopted\k*\im When someone is made part of a family that they weren’t born into. This is what happens when people trust in Jesus. God created human beings to live together with him in peace and love. They were meant to be children in his family. Humans didn’t accept God’s love but chose to follow their own ways.

It was repeated in Psalm 72 and \xt Zechariah 8\xt*. This promise was fulfilled in many ways. One way was through the laws of God’s covenant with the Israelites. The Israelites were to worship God only and obey the Mount Sinai covenant. This would show other nations how wise and understanding God’s people were. It would show other nations that God was near to his people and loved them. This would make other nations want to worship and obey the true God. Another way was through Jesus. Jesus was from Abraham’s family line. All people on earth can be made right with God by believing in Jesus. That is how God’s promise about all nations being blessed is completely fulfilled.

\p \k Book of life\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the book of life. It’s also called God’s book. In the Old Testament, it was a way of talking about people who are alive. It was described as a list of names collected in a book that God writes. In the New Testament, it was a way of talking about people who follow Jesus. It was described as belonging to the Lamb of God. The book of life isn’t an actual book with names written in it. It’s a way of talking about who is alive or who believes in Jesus.
\p \k Born again\k*\im A way of describing what happens when people believe in Jesus as King and Saviour. They stop living as slaves to sin. Being a slave to sin is like being dead spiritually even though the body is alive. When people trust Jesus, he gives their spirit new life. This new birth is a spiritual birth. It’s not the same as someone’s body being born. New life for their bodies will come later when God raises people from the dead.
\p \k Brother-in-law’s duty\k*\im A practice common among many people groups for hundreds of years. It takes care of the widow and the family line of a man who dies. The brother of the man who dies marries the widow and has a child with her. The child is considered the child of the man who died. This child receives the property and carries on the name of the man who died. The child also takes care of the mother when she is old.
\p \k Burnt offerings\k*\im Sacrifices or offerings of clean male animals or birds that people chose to make. The entire animal except for the skin was burnt. This was a sign that the person making the sacrifice was completely committed to God. There were certain times that burnt offerings had to be made. People could also make burnt offerings other times when they wanted to. Trumpets were blown during burnt offerings.
\p \k Buy back\k*\im To get back something or someone that has been given or sold. This is done by paying the price for the thing or the person. Another word for this is to redeem. The one who buys back the thing or person is called the redeemer. God bought back the Israelites when they were slaves in Egypt. This showed that he was their redeemer. When Jesus died on the cross, he paid the price to buy back all sinners. He redeems all who trust in him. He redeems them from the power of sin, death and evil.
\p \k Caesar\k*\im The title for the ruler with most authority in lands controlled by the Roman government. Julius Caesar was the first to use this name. The rulers who came after him also used it. The Caesars after Julius were emperors of Rome. Almost all Caesars treated the people they ruled over very badly. Caesar Augustus was the emperor when Jesus was born. The Romans worshipped the emperor as lord and as the son of the gods. Those who refused to worship the emperor were treated badly. They weren’t allowed to buy and sell in the marketplace. The announcement that Jesus is Lord and God’s Son challenged the authority of Rome’s ruler.
\p \k Caesarea\k*\im The capital city of the Roman territory of Judea in Israel. It was on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Herod the Great had the city built.
\p \k Cain\k*\im The eldest son of Adam and Eve. He was a farmer. He made an offering that didn’t please God. He killed his brother Abel. The ground where he murdered Abel was a witness against him. God brought justice by punishing Cain. He could no longer live in only one place or be a farmer. God protected Cain from being killed by other people.
\p \k Caleb\k*\im A man born a slave in Egypt who entered Canaan with the Israelites. He wasn’t from Jacob’s family line. He was the spy from Judah’s tribe who explored the land of Canaan. He brought back a good report. Caleb obeyed God completely.
\p \k Cana\k*\im A town in Galilee. Two of the seven signs in John’s gospel took place there. The disciple Nathanael was from Cana.
\p \k Canaan\k*\im An area of land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan. In the south it reached almost to the Desert of Sinai. In the north it reached to River Euphrates. The people groups living there before the Israelites were called Canaanites. Many of these groups were from the family line of Ham’s son Canaan. This included the Hittites, Jebusites, Hivites and Amorites. Some Canaanites recognised that God is the true God. Some of them were helpful to God’s people and became part of them. Others refused to worship only God. They were enemies of the people of Israel and God brought judgement against them. Canaan was where the areas now called Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and parts of Syria are. God promised this area to Abraham’s family line. The tribes of Israel lived there after being freed from slavery in Egypt.
\p \k Capernaum\k*\im A city on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus lived in Capernaum for some time and did many miracles there. In Capernaum Jesus invited Peter, Andrew, James, John and Matthew to be his disciples.
\p \k Cast lots\k*\im A process to help people decide about something. It was very common among the people groups who lived around the Israelites. God allowed his people to use this practice. It isn’t known exactly what people did when they cast lots. The Israelites trusted that God guided them to make wise choices through casting lots.
\p \k Christ\k*\im The word in the Greek language for messiah or anointed one. When Jesus lived on earth, many Jews came to believe that he is the Messiah. That is why Jesus is called Christ. (\k Messiah\k*, \k Jesus\k*)
\p \k Christ’s law\k*\im A way of talking about following Jesus’ example for how to live. Jesus commanded his disciples to love God with all their heart, soul, strength and mind. He commanded them to love their neighbour as themselves (Luke 10:27). While he lived on earth, Jesus showed them how to do this. Jesus loved and obeyed his Father. He sacrificed himself for the good of others. He gave up his rights to save the world. He served others to show them how much God loves them.
\p \k Church\k*\im The community of people who follow Jesus. The church started with disciples in Jerusalem who were from Abraham’s family line. The church has grown to include people from any family, place and nation. They are made one through believing in Jesus and believing that he is the Messiah. God’s kingdom spreads on earth when the church follows Jesus faithfully. The church is also called the body of Christ.
\p \k Church elders\k*\im Followers of Jesus who served as church leaders. They taught the message about Jesus faithfully and made sure others did too. They prayed for people and helped make important decisions for the churches.
\p \k Circumcision\k*\im A practice among some people groups in the times and places recorded in the Bible. The foreskin from the male sex organ is cut off. For Israelites, circumcision was a sign. It showed that they were part of the people God made a covenant with. Israelites practiced circumcision only on males who were over eight days old.
\p \k Citizens of heaven\k*\im People are citizens of the nation where they live or where they were born. Believers are also citizens of heaven. This means that they belong to God and are part of his kingdom. This is true even while they are alive on earth. God slowly spreads his kingdom on earth through believers. As citizens of heaven, they are messengers for God’s kingdom. (\k Kingdom of God\k* Daniel 2:1–49).
\p \k Clean or unclean\k*\im The way the Law of Moses described things that could or couldnʼt be near God. These words have a spiritual meaning. They donʼt mean that something is dirty or not dirty. In the Bible, clean things were pure and unclean things were impure. This means that people who were clean could be fully part of Godʼs people. Unclean people had to stay separate and couldnʼt worship God together with others. (\k Pure or impure\k* Leviticus 11:1–15:33.)
\p \k Cloud\k*\im God often made his presence known to people through a cloud. That is how he showed his glory to them. In the Old Testament this happened in the pillar of cloud after the Israelites left Egypt. It happened on Mount Sinai, over the holy tent and over the ark of the covenant. It happened in the Holy Room of the temple and in Ezekiel’s vision of the temple. In the New Testament it happened with Jesus, Peter, James and John on the mountain. It happened when Jesus returned to his Father and in John’s vision of the Son of Man. It will happen again when Jesus returns to earth.
\p \k Cloud of witnesses\k*\im A way of describing people who believe in God and serve him before they die. They are witnesses to who God is while they are alive on earth. A cloud is a way to describe them together as a group. These people have died. Their examples of faith in God encourage believers who are alive. Their spirits wait for when God will raise his people from the dead. The people mentioned in \xt Hebrews 11\xt* are among these witnesses.
\p \k Colossae\k*\im A city in the Roman territory of Asia Minor in what is now called Turkey. Epaphras shared the message about Jesus there and helped start a church. Paul wrote a letter to the church there.
\p \k Concubines\k*\im In Old Testament times and places many men had more than one wife. The man’s main wife had the most authority among the women in the household. The wives called concubines had fewer rights. Often female slaves or servants were forced to be concubines.
\p \k Corinth\k*\im The capital city of the Roman territory of Achaia. It’s in the area that is now southern Greece. Paul visited it on his second and third journeys. He spent over a year there sharing the message of Jesus and helping the church. Two of his letters to the church in Corinth are in the New Testament.
\p \k Cornelius\k*\im A Roman army commander who lived in Caesarea. He wasn’t a Jew but he worshipped the God of Israel. He and his family were among the first Gentiles to follow the Jewish Messiah Jesus.
\p \k Covenant\k*\im An agreement or set of promises like a treaty. Two people or groups made an agreement. One had more power than the other. The one with less power would receive a reward for obeying the treaty or covenant. The reward was the covenant blessings. If they didn’t obey the treaty or covenant, the covenant curses would happen. The people or groups making a covenant would share a meal or make a sacrifice. They would write down their agreement before witnesses. They would each keep a copy. That was how covenants were put into effect. In the Bible, covenants were usually between God and his people.
\p \k Covenant blessings\k*\im Good things that happened when people were faithful to a covenant. In covenants with God, being faithful meant living according to God’s ways. This led to blessings that God provided. These usually had to do with land, children and God’s presence.
\p \k Covenant curses\k*\im Terrible things that happened when people weren’t faithful to a covenant. In covenants with God, not being faithful meant not living according to God’s ways. This stopped the covenant blessings and led to people suffering in many ways. The suffering usually had to do with losing the land God had given them. It had to do with their children dying. And it had to do with God’s presence leaving them.
\p \k Covenant with Abraham\k*\im God chose to work through Abraham and his family in his plan for saving the world. God showed this by making a covenant with Abraham. Abraham was responsible for doing certain things in the covenant. He was to leave his father’s land and people. He was to go to the land of Canaan. He was to be faithful to God. Every male among his family was to be circumcised. Circumcision was the sign of the covenant. As part of the covenant, God promised to do certain things as well. God would give Abraham and his wife Sarah a son. Through that son, God would make Abraham’s family who came after him into a great nation. God would give them the land of Canaan to live in. God would bless Abraham and his family in many ways. Through them God would bless all nations and people groups on earth. God promised to be faithful to his covenant with Abraham’s family for ever. Jesus was from Abraham’s family line. All people and nations on earth were blessed through Jesus. That is how God’s promise to Abraham was completely fulfilled.
\p \k Covenant with David\k*\im God chose to work through David and his family in his plan to save the world. God showed this by making a covenant with David and the sons born after him. God promised to make David’s rule secure and to give the Israelites peace and rest. God promised that sons from David’s family line would rule as kings in Israel. David and his sons after him were to be faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. If they were faithful, God wouldn’t take the kingdom away from David’s family line. They would always be kings over the Israelites. God also promised something else in this covenant. A son from David’s family line would rule for ever over God’s kingdom. This promise didn’t depend on anything David and the sons after him did. It didn’t depend on them being faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. Old Testament writers understood that this was a promise about the Messiah. New Testament writers understood that this promise was fulfilled in Jesus. (\k David\k*)
\p \k Covenant with Noah\k*\im God chose to work through Noah and his family in his plan for saving the world. God showed this by making a covenant with them and all children born after them. The covenant was also with all the creatures that were in the ark. It was with all life on earth. Human beings and animals were to fill the earth. No human beings were to be killed. God promised to never again curse the ground. He promised to never again destroy all life on earth by a flood. The rainbow was the sign of the covenant.
\p \k Creation\k*\im Everything that exists was made by God. This includes the land, the seas, the sky and everything in them. It also includes everything in the heavenly world. All that God created was good when he made it. Creation suffers because of the sins of human beings. God will set it free from the effects of sin in the new creation. (\k New creation\k*).
\p \k Crete\k*\im A large island in the Mediterranean Sea near Greece. Paul travelled to Crete during one of his journeys. He helped start several churches there. Titus stayed on to lead the churches. Some believers in Crete were Jews but most were Gentiles.
\p \k Cross\k*\im Two pieces of wood that were put together so that a person could be nailed onto them. The Romans killed criminals, rebels and slaves this way. This process is called crucifixion. It was done in public to bring shame to the prisoners. It was also done to make people afraid to disobey Roman laws. Dying on a cross was very painful and usually slow. Roman soldiers could make death come quicker by breaking the legs of the criminals. The cross was a sign of terror and death. Jesus talked about the cross to show how his followers must be willing to suffer.
\p \k Cyprus\k*\im A large island in the Mediterranean Sea west of Syria and south of Turkey. Prophets in the Old Testament mentioned Cyprus. The island was important in Paul’s first journey to share the good news. The believers Barnabas and Mnason were from Cyprus.
\p \k Cyrus\k*\im A king of Persia who was also called Cyrus the Great or Cyrus II. God used him as a tool to bring judgement against Babylon. Cyrus took control of Babylonia in 539 BC. Many Jews had been forced to live in Babylon. Cyrus encouraged them to return to Judah. He supported them in rebuilding Jerusalem and the temple. God used Cyrus as a tool to accomplish these things for the Jews.
\p \k Dagon\k*\im A false god worshipped by people groups in and around Canaan. In the Hebrew language the word Dagon means grain. Dagon was understood to be the father of Baal.
\p \k Damascus\k*\im The capital city of the kingdom north of the land of Israel. It’s in the country now called Syria. For many years it was a city of the Arameans. It’s about 300 km north of Jerusalem.

These are recorded in the book of \xt Daniel\xt*.
\p \k Darius\k*\im A king of Persia who was also called Darius the Great or Darius I. God used him as a tool. Darius allowed the Jews to rebuild the temple.
\p \k Darkness\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word darkness. The first meaning is when the sun sets and it’s dark outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that are opposed to God. This darkness causes confusion and problems. It wants to destroy what God has made. Evil and evil spiritual beings are talked about as the kingdom of darkness. (\k Evil spiritual beings\k*)
\p \k David\k*\im A son of Jesse from the tribe of Judah. He was from the family line of Ruth. David was a shepherd when he was young. He followed God faithfully and became Israel’s most famous king. He played instruments and wrote songs and poems. He was faithful to God and worshipped only God. All kings after him were compared to him. God made a covenant with David. (\k Covenant with David\k*)
\p \k Day of Atonement\k*\im This was the day when sins were paid for. It was on the tenth day of the seventh month. It was considered a holy day. It’s also called Yom Kippur by Jews who still celebrate it. The high priest sacrificed a bull for his sins and the sins of his family. He burnt incense and sacrificed one goat for the sins of all the Israelites. He sprinkled the holy tent and the Most Holy Room with the blood. This included sprinkling the altar and the cover of the ark of the covenant. Then the holy tent, the Most Holy Room and the altar were considered clean and pure. A live goat carried the sins of the people into the desert. Because of this, God remained present with the Israelites. (\k Atone\k*)
\p \k Day of the Lord\k*\im In the Old Testament, it was a way to talk about a time of judgement. God would bring judgement against his people or against their enemies. In the New Testament, it means Jesus’ return when he will judge all people (\k Jesus’ return\k*). (\k Judgement day\k*)
\p \k Deacons\k*\im Followers of Jesus who served as church leaders. Deacons worked hard to help meet the needs of believers in the church. The work of the first deacons is described in Acts 6:1–7.
\p \k Dear woman\k*\im A respectful way that Jesus spoke to women. He called some women that he healed dear woman. Other times he called his mother Mary dear woman. It showed kindness and care.
\p \k Death and Hell\k*\im In Revelation, John described death and hell as evil powers that God judged. This means that God stopped death and hell for ever. Because of this, people in God’s kingdom on earth will never die. And people who refuse to join God’s kingdom will be separated from God for ever.
\p \k Deborah\k*\im One of the 12 judges of Israel. She was a prophet in the hill country of Ephraim. She served the Israelites by settling difficult matters for them. She appointed Barak as leader of the attack against Sisera’s army. Her song about their victory is recorded in \xt Judges 5\xt*.
\p \k Delilah\k*\im A Philistine woman whom Samson was in love with. Philistine leaders used her to learn the secret to Samson’s amazing strength. Samson lied to her about it three times. But Delilah begged until Samson finally told her the truth. She received money for handing Samson over to the leaders.
\p \k Derbe\k*\im A city in the Roman territory of Galatia in Asia Minor. Paul visited it on three of his journeys to share the good news about Jesus. It’s thought that Paul’s letter to the Galatians was read to the church there.
\p \k Destroying angel\k*\im An angel who obeys God by destroying something. The act of destroying brings God’s judgement against evil.
\p \k Devil\k*\im The leader of all evil spiritual beings. The devil had served God in heaven. But he stopped worshipping God and started opposing what God wanted done. He could no longer be in God’s presence in heaven. The Bible described this like a star or lightning falling from heaven. In the Bible the devil is also sometimes called Satan. In the Hebrew language the word satan means the one who brings charges against others. The devil is also called the prince of this world and the prince of demons. He tells lies and accuses God’s people of doing wrong. He tries to make them be unfaithful to God. The devil has power to do evil things in the world. God’s power and authority are greater than the devil’s power. In the Garden of Eden, the devil appeared to Eve in the form of a snake. In Revelation, John described the devil as a dragon. (\k Evil spiritual beings\k*)
\p \k Dinah\k*\im The daughter of Jacob and Leah. Her brothers Levi and Simeon killed Shechem after he raped her.
\p \k Disciple\k*\im Someone who follows a teacher or a leader. Disciples do what their teacher does and live like them. While Jesus worked in Israel, he chose certain disciples to be his closest followers. There were 12 of them just like there were 12 tribes of Israel. The 12 disciples were also called apostles. (\k 12 tribes\k*, \k Apostles\k*)
\p \k Divorce\k*\im When people who are married stop being married (\k marriage\k*). The Law of Moses included rules about divorce. Divorce was made official by a written letter when the couple stopped living together. Some prophets used divorce as a picture. It described something about the relationship between the people of Israel and God. They hadn’t been faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. So God allowed his people to be forced to live in exile in Assyria and Babylon. They no longer lived in the land he had given them. This was like when a married couple stopped living together. In this way the exile was like a divorce between God and his people.
\p \k Docetism\k*\im A belief that Jesus didn’t have a human body and wasn’t fully a human being. It was based on a Greek idea. This idea was that bodies were evil. This idea was also that only spiritual things that last for ever were good. Docetism became part of a way of thinking called Gnosticism. Gnosticism explained that the world had problems because people had bodies. Gnostics believed that human beings were saved by having secret knowledge.
\p \k Dreams\k*\im One way that God makes himself and his plans known to people. Sometimes God’s message through a dream is very clear to people. Other times it may not be clear to them. God gives some people the ability to understand other people’s dreams. They help others understand the message from God. Not all dreams are messages from God. People don’t make dreams from God happen. They are a gift from God.
\p \k Dressed in white\k*\im A way of describing when people are obeying God. In the Bible, the colour white is a sign of things that are considered pure. People are pure when they do what God wants done. White clothing is a sign of doing that. In Revelation, people’s clothes become white by being washed in the Lamb’s blood. This means that people trust in Jesus to save them from the power of sin.
\p \k Drive out\k*\im The way that God planned to bring judgement against the Canaanites for their evil ways. God had been patient with them for hundreds of years. Then he brought judgement against them to stop their evil deeds. His judgement was that he would no longer allow them to stay in their land. He would use the Israelites as his tool to drive them out. But the Israelites didn’t obey God completely. They didn’t drive out all the Canaanites. Instead, the Israelites lived with the Canaanites and followed their evil ways.
\p \k Edom\k*\im The land south and east of Judah where Esau’s family line lived. Esau was also called Edom. His children became a strong nation called Edom. The Edomites and the Israelites didn’t live in peace with one another.

\p \k Elders\k*\im Jewish male leaders who were respected and had authority among the Israelites. They made important decisions for God’s people. They were also called the elders of the people or elders of the community. They passed down Jewish teachings, stories and laws through the years.

\p \k Elijah\k*\im A prophet in the northern kingdom of Israel when Ahab and Ahaziah ruled. He was from the land of Gilead. He was known to wear clothes made from hair and a leather belt. His words and actions challenged the authority of rulers in Israel who worshipped false gods. He taught many other prophets. He gave his authority to Elisha to be a prophet after him.

The capital of the northern kingdom was in Ephraim’s land. The northern kingdom is sometimes called Ephraim in the Bible.
\p \k Epicureans\k*\im A group of thinkers who followed the teachings of the Greek thinker Epicurus. They believed that the goal of life was to have complete peace.

\p \k Eternal life\k*\im Life that can’t be destroyed by sin or death. It will last for ever. Jesus was the first human being to have eternal life. It’s the life he had when God raised him from the dead. Jesus gives it to all who believe in him and follow him. They will have eternal life in the new creation. It’s a life of peace and friendship with God.
\p \k Ethiopian official\k*\im An important government official in the region of Ethiopia in Africa. He managed the queen’s money. It isn’t known if he was a Jew.

\p \k Eve\k*\im The second human being God created and the first female. Adam was her husband. In the Hebrew language the name Eve means life giver. God made Eve from one of Adam’s ribs. She had friendship and peace with God while she lived in the Garden of Eden. She worked together with Adam to take care of the garden. She was the mother of Cain, Abel and Seth. When Adam and Eve stopped obeying God, they had to leave the Garden of Eden.
\p \k Evil spiritual beings\k*\im Spiritual beings that God created but that turned against him. These include demons, evil spirits and angels who don’t serve God. Evil spiritual beings work against God. The devil is their leader. They can use their power to control people and to be inside of them. Humans can worship and serve evil spiritual beings instead of God. When humans do this, they become slaves to the power of sin and death. Jesus drove out evil spiritual beings from many people. They can’t be inside of or control people who believe in Jesus and follow him. The Holy Spirit gives Jesus’ followers power to drive evil spiritual beings out like Jesus did. (\k Devil\k*)
\p \k Exile\k*\im When people are forced to leave their homes and land and live somewhere else. This was a covenant curse from the Mount Sinai covenant. Many Israelites from the northern kingdom were exiled in Assyria. They never returned to the land of Israel. Many Israelites from the southern kingdom were exiled in Babylonia. Some of them returned to the land of Judah.
\p \k Exodus\k*\im When God used Moses to rescue the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. In the Greek language the word exodus means to exit or to leave. The exodus was the time when God showed himself to be the Saviour of Israel. He did mighty works and brought judgement against Pharaoh, Egypt and Egypt’s false gods. The exodus is a picture of the salvation that God offers to all human beings. The death of the lambs is a picture of Jesus’s death many years later. Jesus was sacrificed as the Lamb of God. The blood of the lambs was put on the doors to save the Israelites. This is a picture of how Jesus’ blood saves those who believe in him. The Israelites were freed from slavery. This is a picture of how God frees those who trust in him. He frees them from slavery to the power of sin, death and evil.
\p \k Explain other languages\k*\im When people explain the meaning of a message spoken in a language they didn’t know before. The Holy Spirit has given some believers the ability to do this.

\p \k Faith\k*\im There are several meanings for faith in the Bible. The first meaning is the things people believe about God. God wants all people to believe what is true about him. These are things that God has shown about himself and ways that he has acted. In the New Testament, these things include the message of the good news about Jesus. The second meaning of faith is the belief itself. This is the trust that people have in God. It’s based on their hope of how God will keep his promises.

God’s people are to follow God’s ways for living. Jesus showed people how to do this. Faith in Jesus includes following his example for living.
\p \k False gods\k*\im Anything that people worship that is more important to them than the true God. People worship things because they believe they have power. The devil uses their worship of these things to trap people and control them. The people groups in the Bible made pictures or statues of some of these things. Pictures or statues of false gods are objects that have no power.
\p \k False prophet\k*\im A person who pretends to be a prophet. They share messages that aren’t from God. They do this to try to trick people. (\k Prophet\k*)
\p \k Family line\k*\im A list of people in a family. These lists were very important in the times and places of the Bible. They are also called genealogies. They included certain people in the family but not everyone. They usually included only men. The word son was a way of talking about sons, grandsons or great-grandsons. The lists sometimes included extra information or stories about certain people. Older people told the names and stories to younger people in the family. This way everyone learnt about the family line. Many family lines are recorded in the Bible. They showed what tribe an Israelite or a Jew was from. They showed whether someone could be a priest or came from a royal family.
\p \k Family protector\k*\im A close male relative who was responsible for helping family members in need. Another name for this is redeemer.

The family protector could also carry out the brother-in-law’s duty. He could do this for the widow of his brother. The family protector was a picture of how God took care of Israel. God was like the family protector who rescued the Israelites when they were in need. The family protector is also a picture of what Jesus does. He’s like the family protector who rescues sinners who are in need. He redeems all who trust in him. He buys them back them from the power of sin, death and evil.
\p \k Fasting\k*\im Going without food. People in Israel would fast to help them pay attention to prayer. They would fast to show that they were sorry for their sin. Going without food would help them pay attention to a goal they wanted to reach. They would also fast to mourn something sad that had happened. Jesus taught that fasting was part of worshipping and serving God. It’s an important practice that can help people as they pray.
\p \k Father\k*\im One name for God. The Father is God just like Jesus is God and the Holy Spirit is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. God showed himself to be Israel’s Father during the exodus and called Israel his son. Later, God showed himself to be the Father of Jesus. Jesus shows that God is the Father of all who are part of God’s family.
\p \k Father’s blessing\k*\im Final words that a father spoke out loud to his children before he died. The father would say what he thought or hoped would happen later in his children’s lives.

\p \k Feast of Booths\k*\im The Jewish feast that started five days after the day when sins were paid for. The people celebrated the harvest and how God provided for them. Israelite males were required to travel to the holy tent or temple for this feast. During the seven days of the feast, they slept in booths. This was to remember how they had lived in booths or tents in the desert. Every seven years the covenant law was to be read out loud during this feast.
\p \k Feast of Purim\k*\im The Jewish feast to celebrate being rescued from Haman’s plan to destroy all Jews. It isn’t one of the feasts described in the Law of Moses. Jews began celebrating it when the Persian government was in control. They celebrated it on the 14th and 15th days of the 12th month. It was named Purim because Haman cast lots to decide when to destroy the Jews. In the Hebrew language the word Pur means lots. Esther and Mordecai’s order rescued the Jews from Haman’s plans. The feast was to be a joyful time of good food and giving gifts to the poor. Reading the book of \xt Esther\xt* out loud became a common practice during the Feast of Purim.
\p \k Feast of Trumpets\k*\im The first day of the seventh month. Rams’ horns were blown like trumpets. It was nine days before the day when sins were paid for. The Israelites used those days to rest and to think about and admit their sins. They used them to get ready for the Day of Atonement. This feast is now called Rosh Hashanah. It’s now considered the first day of the new year for Jews.
\p \k Feast of Unleavened Bread\k*\im The Jewish feast that lasted for seven days after Passover. During this time the bread that the Israelites ate didn’t have yeast in it. This was to remind them of the exodus. When God freed them from slavery, they left Egypt quickly. They didn’t have time to use yeast in their bread. Israelite males were required to travel to the holy tent or temple for this feast.
\p \k Feasts\k*\im Activities that helped the Israelites remember who God is. Feasts helped them remember that God would continue to protect them and provide for them.

\p \k Forgive\k*\im Several words from the Hebrew and Greek languages are used in the Bible for the word forgive. These words describe in many ways what it means to forgive and to be forgiven. A debt of money can be forgiven. This means that the person who owes money no longer must pay it back. Sin can be forgiven. God is the one who forgives sin. This means that God recognises what sin has been committed. God recognises which person or group of people is guilty of that sin. Guilt is like a heavy weight that God lifts off someone when he forgives. God removes the guilt of the person or group. It’s like God takes the sin and releases it somewhere far away. God chooses to not bring judgement against the person or group because of their sin. God is always ready to forgive people for their sin. This is because he is full of mercy and love. God wants all people and all groups of people to turn away from sin. He wants them to ask him to forgive them. God also wants all people and all groups of people to follow his example. He wants them to forgive one another for their sins.
\p \k Four living creatures\k*\im Spiritual beings seen by Ezekiel and John in visions. Like the seraphs in Isaiah’s vision they give glory to God. They worship God and do what he wants done. Ezekiel called them cherubim. There were statues of these beings over the ark of the covenant.
\p \k Friendship offerings\k*\im Sacrifices or offerings people made to show that they were grateful to God. These offerings showed the close relationship between God and his people. That is why they are called friendship offerings. They were also made as part of fulfilling a promise someone had made. The offerings could be anything that someone wanted to give. The supplies the people gave to build the holy tent and the temple were friendship offerings. Animals were sacrificed as part of the friendship offerings. Flour, oil and wine were also offered.

Many stories from Jesus’ life happened in Galilee and around the Sea of Galilee.
\p \k Gamaliel\k*\im A Pharisee and rabbi who was a wise and respected member of the Sanhedrin. The apostle Paul studied Jewish law with Gamaliel before following Jesus.
\p \k Garden of Eden\k*\im The garden that God made when he created the world. The first human beings lived and worked there. Life in the Garden of Eden was how God wanted his world to be.

Humans didn’t need to protect themselves from anything in the garden.
\p \k Gentile\k*\im A name used in the Bible for everyone who wasn’t from Jacob’s family line. Most Gentiles didn’t know about Israel’s God or Israel’s history. They didn’t know about the Law of Moses and didn’t follow Jewish laws. (\k Law of Moses\k*)

\p \k Gilead\k*\im The hill country east of the River Jordan. Part of it belonged to the kingdom of Sihon. Another part belonged to the kingdom of Og. That was before the Israelites won the battles over Sihon and Og. It was named after Gilead who was from the family line of Manasseh. It had rich soil and was good for raising livestock. It wasn’t part of the land God had promised to give Abraham’s family line. But God allowed some tribes to lived there. These were the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\p \k Gilgal\k*\im A Canaanite city west of the River Jordan near Jericho. It became an important place for Israelite leaders, kings and prophets. The stones collected from the River Jordan were set up there. This reminded the Israelites how God had led them into Canaan.
\p \k Glory\k*\im The wonderful beauty, majesty, goodness and presence of God. It’s a way of talking about who God is and how pure and holy he is. Only the Creator has this glory. He chooses to share it with those he has created. Created beings show God’s glory when they carry out his plans for his creation.
\p \k Go-between\k*\im Someone who helps people or groups talk with one another and come to an agreement. This is also called a mediator. Moses did this between the people of Israel and God at Mount Sinai. The people couldn’t come close to God. They were afraid of him. Being close to God’s holiness would have harmed them. So Moses told the people what God wanted to say to them. Then he told God what the people wanted to say to God. In this way he helped them establish the Mount Sinai covenant. Later, Jesus became the mediator between God and all human beings. Because human beings commit sin, they are unable to live in peace with God. Jesus is fully a human being and fully God. Jesus dealt with the problem of sin when he died on the cross. So humans can now be forgiven for sin and live in peace with God. In this way Jesus is the go-between of the new covenant.
\p \k God\k*\im The Creator of everything that exists. In the Bible God is called Lord (\k Lord\k*). He is also called Lord (\k Lord\k*). God is love and is the only true God. God does what is right. God is full of grace. God is a spiritual being. In the Bible God is often described as if he were like human beings. The Bible talks about God’s face, eyes, back, hands, arms, fingers and other parts. It talks about God’s mind and heart and God’s feelings. These ways of describing God don’t mean that he has a body like humans do. They are signs and pictures to help humans understand something about who God is and his actions.
\p \k God chooses\k*\im God is free to do anything he wants to do. The stories in the Bible describe some choices that God made. Choosing to make a covenant with Abraham and his family line is one example. The stories don’t fully explain why God made those choices. They do make it clear that God is good and can be trusted. He makes choices based on his knowledge and his love. Human beings don’t understand all of God’s choices. But they can trust that God is loving, wise and good.
\p \k God’s anger\k*\im The Bible describes God as angry at sin and evil. He shows his anger by bringing judgement against those who refuse to stop doing evil. He brings judgement against those who refuse to repent and turn away from sin. Writers in the Bible described God’s anger like a winepress. In a winepress, grapes are crushed to make wine. Writers in the Bible also described God’s anger like a cup of wine. Those who refused to stop sinning and doing evil deeds had to drink it. These were pictures of God’s judgement. They were pictures of how God stops those who do evil and punishes them. People who believe in Jesus are set free from the power of sin and evil. Because of this, they are saved from God’s anger against sin and evil. In Revelation, God’s anger and the Lamb’s anger are the same thing.
\p \k God’s family\k*\im The relationship that God wants with all human beings. God’s family is different from human families. In the times and places of the Bible, families were usually led by older men. Families included older women, younger men and women and children. Slaves were also part of the household. The men had authority over women and children. Slave owners had authority over slaves. This system is what the nations and people groups of that time were based on. The gospels, Paul’s letters and Peter’s letters explained what God’s family is like. People who follow Jesus all belong to the family of God. God adopts them as his children. Each family member is loved and accepted by God. So they must treat one another with respect and love. Some believers have authority over others. They must use it to bless and serve others. Some believers do not have authority over others. They should do everything they do as if they are serving Jesus.
\p \k God’s people\k*\im A way to talk about the nation of Israel. After Jesus came, anyone who follows him is considered part of God’s people. Every human being is invited to follow Jesus. This is true no matter what family, group or nation people come from. It’s true no matter what language they speak. Worshipping Jesus brings them together as one in God’s family. (\k Israel\k*)
\p \k God’s servant\k*\im A servant that God promised to send to help God’s people. The book of \xt Isaiah\xt* includes several prophecies about this servant. God chose this servant to share God’s teaching with his people. God set this servant apart to lead his people with justice. He would suffer as he served. The servant is sometimes described as the people of Israel. He is sometimes described as a prophet or someone else who helped God’s people. Other times the servant is described as a saviour who would come in the future. In \xt Acts 3\xt*, Peter showed how the servant described in Isaiah was also the Jewish Messiah. Peter then showed how Jesus is this Servant and Messiah.
\p \k God’s tool\k*\im Throughout the Bible God uses people, groups and nations as his tool to bring judgement. Through them he brings judgement against people, groups or nations that do evil things. This is part of how he stops evil and brings back peace. God decides when to bring judgement and how to do it. Those that God uses as a tool aren’t better than those being judged. Every person, group and nation is responsible for serving and obeying God. They will all be judged for the evil things they do.
\p \k God’s word\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are many meanings for God’s word or the word of God. The first meaning is anything God speaks. This includes laws, promises, prophecies and everything God says. God spoke words to create the world. God’s words are powerful and cause things to happen. The second meaning is a name for Jesus. Jesus is called both the Word and God’s Word. These titles mean that God created the world through Jesus. They mean that Jesus has always lived and was never not living. They mean that Jesus shows people who God is. The third meaning for God’s word is the collection of holy writings studied by God’s people. This is also called Scripture. The Old Testament was understood to be God’s word and the Scripture. This was true for God’s people before the time of Jesus. For believers in New Testament times, God’s word also included Jesus’ teachings. The apostles preached God’s word. This included the message about Jesus in the Old Testament. It also included everything that Jesus taught. The Old and New Testaments together are understood to be God’s word and the Scripture. This is true for believers after New Testament times. (\k Bible\k*)
\p \k Golden altar\k*\im In John’s vision of God’s throne there was a golden altar. This showed that the area with the throne was also a temple. It was the pattern the Israelites and Jews used for the holy tent and temple (Hebrews 8:1–5). (\k Altar\k*)
\p \k Good news\k*\im The message about Jesus. In the Greek language the entire message is called the gospel. (\k Gospel\k*) It’s the message that God rescues people from the power of sin and death. This means that people can fully worship their Creator. They can live in peace with him and with others. This can happen because Jesus gave his life to save all human beings. He died as a sacrifice to free people from being slaves to evil. Then God raised Jesus from the dead. Jesus is the Jewish Messiah that God had promised to send. He brings God’s eternal life and the power of resurrection to all who believe him.
\p \k Good works\k*\im Things that people do that please God. Believers don’t do good works in order to earn God’s love and grace. They do them because of God’s love and grace in their lives.

Good works include taking care of God’s creation and serving others. Good works bring blessing to others and praise to God.

\p \k Groups of sevens\k*\im In John’s visions, he saw God’s judgement happen in groups of seven things. There were seven seals, seven trumpets and seven bowls. At the end of each group there was lightning, thunder and an earthquake. In the Bible, seven is the number for things being complete.
\p \k Guilt offerings\k*\im Sacrifices or offerings for when people were unfaithful to God and sinned without meaning to. They were also for when people sinned against others. God required people to make these sacrifices. When people realised what they had done wrong, they had to stop. They had to turn back to God and trust him to forgive them. They would show this by making a guilt offering. Sacrificing a ram was a way to pay for the sin the person had done. Then the guilty person had to return what they had taken. They also had to pay back extra to the person they had harmed. The priests burnt part of the guilt offering. Other parts they ate inside the courtyard of the holy tent or temple.

This means that they are to be completely committed to living according to God’s ways.
\p \k Heaven\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word heaven. The first meaning is the sky above the earth. The second meaning is where God the King and Creator rules.

They were to live in peace with one another and with the rest of creation. But Adam and Eve sinned. Since then sin and death have had control over human beings. Human beings sin. Human beings die.
\p \k I am\k*\im The name that God used to describe himself to Moses in \xt Exodus 3:14\xt*. The name is made up of the Hebrew letters YHWH. No one knows exactly what this name means. The letters YHWH sound like the Hebrew words for I am who I am. God is who he is and he chooses what he does. No one and nothing make God be or do anything. Jesus used these same words to describe who he is in the book of \xt John\xt*.
\p \k I am statements\k*\im A way that Jesus used to tell people who he is. In John’s gospel Jesus used the words I am in a special way seven times. With these words he described himself and the work he was doing on earth. God used the words I am when he told Moses his name in \xt Exodus 3:14\xt*.
\p \k Iconium\k*\im A city in the Roman territory of Galatia in Asia Minor. Paul visited it on three of his journeys to share the good news about Jesus. It’s thought that Paul’s letter to the Galatians was read to the church there.
\p \k Immanuel\k*\im A name in the Hebrew language that means God is with us. In the time of King Ahaz, Isaiah prophesied about a boy named Immanuel. He would be a sign that God was with the southern kingdom. This child was a sign that the southern kingdom would be saved. They would be saved from enemy armies that attacked them. Isaiah’s prophecy also had a meaning for the future. Matthew wrote about this in his gospel. Through Jesus, God was with his people in a human body. Jesus is the Immanuel who saves God’s people from the enemies of sin and death.
\p \k In Jesus’ name\k*\im People can do something in the name of someone else. When they do this, it means they are doing it with that person’s authority. They are doing it as if that other person were the one doing it. The disciples prayed, spoke and acted in Jesus’ name. This showed that they believed Jesus has complete authority in heaven and on earth. It also showed that they were doing the work Jesus had taught them to do. People were baptised in Jesus’ name. This means that they went through baptism because they believed in Jesus. Their baptism showed that they were completely committed to following Jesus.
\p \k Incense\k*\im Something that is burnt to make smoke that smells good. Many people groups throughout history have used incense in their worship practices. God gave instructions to priests in Israel about how to burn it. They used shallow cups to burn it on an altar. It was an offering to honour God. The incense smelled sweet and this reminded God’s people that God gave them good things. Smoke from incense was also a sign of prayers being prayed to God.
\p \k Isaac\k*\im The son God promised Abraham that he would have with his wife Sarah. Isaac married Rebekah and was the father of Jacob and Esau. In the Hebrew language, Isaac means he laughs. God continued his covenant with Abraham through Isaac.

\p \k Israel\k*\im The name that God gave Jacob. In the Hebrew language Israel means someone who struggles or wrestles with God. All people from Jacob’s family line were called the people of Israel. They are known as Israelites. God made the Mount Sinai covenant with them (\k Mount Sinai covenant\k*). He chose them to show all other people groups who he is. Israel also was the name of the land where Jacob’s family line lived after the exodus. After King Solomon died, the northern kingdom was called Israel.
\p \k Jacob\k*\im The youngest son of Isaac and Rebekah and a grandson of Abraham. He was Esau’s twin brother and was also given the name Israel. The 12 tribes of Israel are named after his sons and grandsons (\k 12 tribes\k*).
\p \k Jacob wrestled\k*\im Jacob wrestled with the man who blessed him on his way to Canaan. This was right before Jacob met Esau. A prophecy in Hosea 12:4 explained that the man was understood to be an angel. He gave Jacob the name Israel. Jacob understood that he had wrestled with God.
\p \k Jael\k*\im A woman from the Kenite people group who lived among the Israelites. Heber was her husband. She was from the family line of Moses’ brother-in-law Hobab. She killed a Canaanite military leader named Sisera. Jael was an important part of the song Deborah sang about the Israelites’ victory in \xt Judges 5\xt*.

\p \k Jealous\k*\im One way that God describes himself. He isn’t jealous in the sinful way that human beings can be jealous. Human beings can be jealous of others who have something they themselves need or want. God is jealous when human beings worship false gods. This is because he is the only true God. He is the only one worthy of being worshipped.
\p \k Jebusites\k*\im A people group that lived in Canaan. They were from the family line of Ham’s son Canaan. God told the Israelites to drive them out of the land as his judgement against them. They lived in the city of Jerusalem before David took control of it.
\p \k Jehoiada\k*\im An important priest when Athaliah was queen and later when Joash was king. His wife was Jehosheba. Jehoiada was the father of Zechariah and was Joash’s uncle. He taught Joash to be faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. Jehoiada led the people of Jerusalem to stop following Athaliah and to have her killed. Then he led them to make Joash king and to follow God’s covenant. When Jehoiada died the people honoured him by burying him with the kings of Judah. Later Joash put Jehoiada’s son Zechariah to death.

\p \k Jericho\k*\im A city west of the River Jordan and east of Jerusalem. It was also called the City of Palm Trees. It had rich soil and plenty of water. God destroyed the city when the Israelites marched around it. Many years later it became an important city in Israel. Zacchaeus was from Jericho.
\p \k Jeroboam\k*\im The son of Nebat and Zeruah who was an official in Solomon’s government. He was from the tribe of Ephraim. He became the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel. God promised to make his rule secure if Jeroboam served him faithfully. But Jeroboam stopped the Israelites from worshipping God the way God had told them to. Jeroboam appointed people who weren’t Levites to be priests. He led the people to worship golden statues of calves. These actions were called the sins of Jeroboam. Because of these sins Jeroboam’s family line was destroyed.
\p \k Jerusalem\k*\im The capital city of the Israelites when David and Solomon were kings. Later it was the capital city of the land of Judah and Judea. It had been a Jebusite city in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. David captured it and made it the centre of Israel’s government and worship practices. The temple was built on a hilltop in Jerusalem called Mount Moriah or Mount Zion. Zion became a way to talk about all of Jerusalem. Jerusalem was also called the City of David. The Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem in the year 586 BC. Jews later rebuilt it and Jerusalem remained the centre for Jewish government and for worshipping God. It’s the capital city of the nation of Israel today. Jerusalem is in between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan.
\p \k Jesus\k*\im The Son of God who became a human being. He is the Saviour of the world. Jesus is God just like the Father is God and the Holy Spirit is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. In the Hebrew language, Jesus means the Lord saves. Jesus lived on earth from around the year 4 BC to around AD 30. He lived in the land of Israel while the Roman government was in control. When he lived on earth, Jesus’s mother was Mary. She became pregnant with Jesus even though she hadn’t had sex with anyone. The Holy Spirit made this possible. Joseph was the human father who raised Jesus when he was young. Jesus came from the family lines of Abraham, Judah and David. Jesus grew up in Nazareth with brothers and sisters. He was put to death on a cross. Then God raised him from the dead. He won the victory over sin, death and all evil spiritual beings. He is the Messiah and King that God had promised to send. Now Jesus rules as King in heaven. He will return to earth to rule as King over everything that God created.
\p \k Jesus’ return\k*\im When Jesus returns to earth to rule completely as King. After he was raised from the dead, he went to rule with the Father in heaven. When he returns, all people will recognise that he is Lord and King. Jesus will stop all evil on earth. He will bring heaven and earth together as one in God’s kingdom.
\p \k Jethro\k*\im Moses’ father-in-law and a priest in Midian. He was also called Reuel. He was part of the Kenite people group. He welcomed Moses when Moses ran away from Egypt. His daughter Zipporah became Moses’ wife. He stayed with the Israelites as they travelled from Mount Sinai to Canaan.
\p \k Jew\k*\im A name for people from Jacob’s family line. In the Hebrew language Jew means from the tribe of Judah. But Israelites from all tribes were called Jews. They were called Jews after Babylon took control of the southern kingdom. Most people in the southern kingdom were from the tribe of Judah. The Babylonian army forced many people from the southern kingdom to live in Babylon in exile. Later those who moved back to Judah from exile were also called Jews. (\k Hebrew\k*, \k Family line\k*)
\p \k Jewish laws\k*\im The Jewish way of life was based on Jewish laws. Many of these laws came from the Law of Moses. Jewish religious leaders also added laws and rules to those earlier laws. Some of these extra laws and rules helped people obey the Law of Moses. Others made life very difficult for Jews. Certain religious leaders used the laws to control what people did. They also used them to make themselves look better. They did this to make it appear that God favoured them over other people. (\k Ten Commandments\k*, \k Law of Moses\k*)
\p \k Jezebel\k*\im The daughter of the king of Sidon. She married Ahab and ruled as queen of the northern kingdom of Israel. She wasn’t an Israelite. She did many evil things. She killed many prophets of God but supported many prophets of Baal (1 Kings 16:29–21:29). Jezebel was also the name given to a false prophet in the church in Thyatira (Revelation 2:20). This person led many believers to sin. They claimed to have special knowledge about the devil. There may have been a woman named Jezebel doing these things. Or Jesus may have used the name to show how this person was like Queen Jezebel. This false prophet was leading people to worship false gods.
\p \k Joab\k*\im A nephew of David who was a mighty fighter. He became the commander of Israel’s armies under David. He was faithful to David for many years. But he went against David by murdering Abner and Amasa. He also went against David by killing Absalom. He didn’t support Solomon as the king after David. Because of these things, David ordered Solomon to have Joab killed.
\p \k Joash\k*\im The son of Ahaziah and Zibia. He was the father of Amaziah and was from the tribe of Judah. He was the seventh king of the southern kingdom. His grandmother Athaliah tried to murder him but his aunt Jehosheba saved him. Joash grew up in the temple with Jehoiada. He became king when he was seven years old. He made sure that the temple was repaired. He followed God faithfully and led the people to worship only God. He did this for as long as Jehoiada was alive. After Jehoiada died, Joash did evil things and worshipped false gods.
\p \k Job\k*\im The main person in the story told in the book of \xt Job\xt*. He was from Uz. It’s thought that Uz was in Edom. It’s thought that Job wasn’t from Jacob’s family line. He worshipped the one true God faithfully. God tested Job by allowing him to suffer. Job asked God many questions and spoke honestly about his feelings. Throughout the test, he remained faithful to God.
\p \k John\k*\im The writer of the Gospel of John. He also wrote books 1, 2 and 3 John. It’s thought that he also wrote the book of \xt Revelation\xt*. John was one of Jesus’ 12 disciples and one of his three closest followers. In the Gospel of John he is called the disciple whom Jesus loved. His brother was James and their father was Zebedee. Jesus called James and John the sons of thunder.
\p \k John the Baptist\k*\im The son of Elizabeth and Zechariah and a relative of Jesus. The angel Gabriel announced his birth. He was a prophet and was like Elijah in many ways (\k Elijah\k*). He lived in the desert and wore a leather belt and clothes made from hair. He preached to Jews about turning away from sin. He baptised people and helped them get ready for Jesus to come. King Herod Antipas had him put to death.
\p \k Jonah\k*\im A prophet from the northern kingdom of Israel. He was the son of Amittai. He prophesied about the northern kingdom’s borders. This prophecy was fulfilled when King Jeroboam the second ruled. A story about Jonah is recorded in the book of \xt Jonah\xt*.
\p \k Jonathan\k*\im A son of Saul and Ahinoam. He was from the tribe of Benjamin. Jonathan supported God’s plan to make David king instead of himself. He made a covenant of friendship with David. Because of their friendship, David treated Jonathan’s son Mephibosheth well.
\p \k Joseph\k*\im The eldest son of Jacob and Rachel. He was Jacob’s favourite son. In the Hebrew language Joseph means may he add. Rachel gave him this name because she wanted more children. Some of his brothers sold him as a slave to Egypt. He later became a ruler of Egypt and saved many people from dying of hunger. His wife was Asenath. The family lines of his sons Manasseh and Ephraim became tribes of Israel.
\p \k Joseph of Nazareth\k*\im The husband of Mary of Nazareth. He was from the family line of David and served God faithfully. He was a carpenter skilled at working with wood, bricks and metal. He wasn’t the father of Jesus but adopted Jesus as his son. He took care of Jesus and protected him while he was young.
\p \k Joshua\k*\im A man born a Hebrew slave in Egypt. He helped Moses lead God’s people during the exodus. He was the son of Nun and was from the tribe of Ephraim. Moses changed his name from Hoshea to Joshua. He was one of the spies who explored the land of Canaan. He brought back a good report. He became the leader of the Israelites after Moses died. Joshua led the Israelites into the land that God had promised to give Abraham.
\p \k Joshua and Zerubbabel\k*\im Jewish leaders who returned to Judah from being exiled in Babylon. They led God’s people to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. Joshua was the son of Jozadak and served as high priest in the second temple. This is a different Joshua to the one who led the Israelites after Moses. Zerubbabel served as the governor of Judah while the Persian government was in control. He was the son of Shealtiel and was from David’s family line. Jesus is from Zerubbabel’s family line.
\p \k Judah\k*\im A son of Jacob and Leah. In the Hebrew language his name means praise or giving thanks. Judah slept with his daughter-in-law Tamar. That is how he became the father of Perez and Zerah. Jacob’s blessing over him included a prophecy that kings would come from his family line. Both King David and Jesus the Messiah came from Judah’s family line. Judah’s family line became an important tribe in Israel. The tribe of Judah became the main tribe of the southern kingdom. The southern kingdom of the nation of Israel became known as Judah. This continued when the Babylonian government took control of the southern kingdom. That land was also known as Judah when the Persian government was in control.
\p \k Judas\k*\im One of Jesusʼ 12 disciples. His father was James. Matthew and Mark called this disciple Thaddeus. Luke and John called him Judas. He wasn’t the Judas who handed Jesus over to be killed.
\p \k Judas Iscariot\k*\im One of Jesus’ 12 disciples. He was in charge of the disciples’ money but stole from it. He handed Jesus over to the Jewish leaders who wanted to kill him. Later he killed himself.
\p \k Jude\k*\im One of Jesus’ brothers. At first he didn’t believe that Jesus was the Messiah. Later he trusted Jesus and became a leader among the churches. The New Testament includes one letter that he wrote.
\p \k Judea\k*\im The southern area of the land God had promised to give Abraham’s family line. It included land that had been called the southern kingdom of Judah. It was called Judea after some of God’s people returned from exile in Babylon. The tribe of Judah lived in Judea. Jerusalem was the most important city in Judea.
\p \k Judge\k*\im A leader who made decisions about laws. Each community in Israel had local judges. There were also judges at the holy tent and the temple. They made decisions about cases that were too hard for local judges. Levites helped judges make their decisions. Kings in Israel also served as judges by making decisions about cases. Judges were always to do what was right and fair. The people were to respect them and obey their decisions.
\p \k Judgement\k*\im Suffering and punishment for doing what goes against what God wants. God brings judgement against people, people groups and evil spiritual beings. He brings judgement to stop sinful things and evil deeds. Judgement against evil is how God brings justice back to his world. Judgement from God can feel painful and can lead to people dying. It can also lead people to repent and to turn away from sin and evil. It can teach people to do what God wants done. This allows people to live in peace with God and with one another.
\p \k Judgement day\k*\im The time in the future when God will judge all humans and all spiritual beings. He will show if their thoughts, desires and actions agree with what he wants for his world. He will show if they have followed his ways. He will fully separate evil from good. He will completely destroy for ever all that is evil. All that is good will exist for ever in peace and joy with God. (\k Day of the Lord\k* Joel 1:1–20.)
\p \k Kadesh Barnea\k*\im An area southwest of the Dead Sea in the Desert of Zin. The Israelites camped there as they travelled from Egypt to Canaan. From there the Israelites refused to enter Canaan. Kadesh is where Miriam died. It is also where Moses disobeyed God by hitting a rock to get water.
\p \k King\k*\im The ruler with the highest authority among certain people groups. God was to be the King of the Israelites. Human kings in Israel were supposed to lead the people the way God led them. This was very different from how kings of other people groups led. Israelite kings were to study God’s laws and obey them. They were to help the people stay faithful to God’s covenant. Israelite kings were to protect people who were weak and needy. They shouldn’t have many wives or become very rich. They were to be humble. They shouldn’t treat their people as slaves. They shouldn’t trust in weapons and horses for winning battles. Israelite kings were to trust in God and serve him only.
\p \k Kingdom of God\k*\im God’s rule as King over all that he created. This includes heaven and earth. The kingdom of God is also called the kingdom of heaven. One day everyone will recognise that God has complete authority and all power. Everyone and everything will serve and worship only God. Life for everything God created will be the way God always wanted it to be. Jesus announced the message about God’s kingdom. He taught about it through parables. It comes to earth in a slow process. It started through Jesus’ work. It keeps spreading as the church continues to be faithful to Jesus. (\k Heaven\k*)
\p \k Kingdom of priests\k*\im God wanted the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. They would become these things if they were faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. Like other people groups, they would become a kingdom and a nation. But God didn’t want them to live like other people groups. He wanted them to be a different kind of kingdom and nation. Every Israelite would know God closely and serve him. In this way they would be like priests. All together they would obey God and treat others the way God taught them to. This would show how different they were from other nations. In this way they would be set apart or holy like God was holy. That is how the Israelites would be a holy nation.
\p \k Korah\k*\im A man born a Hebrew slave in Egypt. He was from the tribe of Levi but wasn’t from Aaron’s family line. In the desert, he led many people to oppose Moses and Aaron. God destroyed him and those who followed him. Later, some of the people from his family line served God faithfully. This included the prophet Samuel and men known as the sons of Korah. They led Israel in worshipping God with psalms.
\p \k Laban\k*\im The son of Bethuel and brother of Rebekah from Mesopotamia. He was the father of Rachel and Leah. He tricked Jacob and took advantage of him for many years.
\p \k Lamb of God\k*\im A title for Jesus that describes how he sacrificed himself. During the first Passover, lambs were sacrificed. Because of their blood the Israelites were saved from being destroyed. After that, lambs were used in Jewish worship practices as a sacrifice for sin. Jesus sacrificed himself by giving up his life on the cross. His sacrifice saves people from being destroyed by sin, death and evil. In this way he is like the lambs sacrificed by the Israelites. In Revelation, Jesus looked to the prophet John like a Lamb that had been killed. Yet the Lamb was alive. This is because Jesus was raised from the dead after he died on the cross.
\p \k Laodicea\k*\im A city in the Roman territory of Asia Minor in what is now called Turkey. It was near Colossae. Epaphras shared the message about Jesus there and helped start a church. Paul wrote the Laodicean church a letter. The church in Laodicea is one of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation.
\p \k Last days\k*\im A way to talk about a time in the future. Some prophets in the Bible described it as a time when God would take action. He would take action to make sure that all people honoured him. Other writers in the Bible described it as a time of suffering. It would be a time before God judged the world. People would do many evil things during that time. Some New Testament writers described the time after Jesus’ resurrection as the last days. It was considered the time the church lives in until Jesus returns to earth.
\p \k Law of Moses\k*\im There are two meanings for the Law of Moses. The first meaning is God’s instructions for the Israelites about how to live their lives. This is also called the law. It includes the Ten Commandments. God gave these instructions through Moses. Some of the laws were about worshipping God in proper ways. Other laws were about how the Israelites were to treat one another. Others dealt with how the Israelites were to live together in communities and as a nation. The second meaning of the Law of Moses is the first five books of the Old Testament. That is where all the laws are recorded. These books are also called the Torah and the Pentateuch. In the Hebrew language Torah means law. In the Greek language Pentateuch means five scrolls. (\k Ten Commandments\k*, \k Jewish laws\k*)
\p \k Laws in Leviticus\k*\im God gave Moses and Aaron laws for how the Israelites were to live together. Many of them were general rules about things that might have happened in those days. They were to help the people learn about who God is. The laws helped them to make wise decisions about everyday matters. God’s people were to make all their decisions based on who God is.
\p \k Leader who serves\k*\im Jesus is the example for how everyone should treat others. This includes people with authority, power and honour. It includes leaders of any group of human beings. Jesus is the King of all that God created. He came to earth to serve people so they would understand God’s love for them. He didn’t use his power and authority to force people to do what he wanted. He didn’t make people treat him like he was more important than anyone else. Instead he was humble. He showed deep concern for all people. He gave up his life to show people God’s love. All believers are to follow Jesus’ example of loving and serving others. The Holy Spirit gives Jesus’ followers different gifts and abilities to use to serve others. When believers serve others, they are also serving Jesus.
\p \k Leah\k*\im The eldest daughter of Laban and first wife of Jacob. Rachel was her sister and Zilpah was her servant. She became the mother of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun and Dinah.
\p \k Letters to the churches\k*\im Jesus commanded John to write letters with messages to seven churches. Each letter began by describing Jesus in a different way. In most of the letters, Jesus mentioned ways that the church was living faithfully. In most he also mentioned ways the church wasn’t being faithful to him. Jesus urged the believers in each church to listen to the Holy Spirit. Jesus finished each letter with a promise. The promise was for those who shared in his victory over the power of sin.
\p \k Levi\k*\im A son of Jacob and Leah. In the Hebrew language Levi means attached. His family line became a tribe of Israel. All priests in Israel came from Levi’s family line.
\p \k Levites\k*\im People from the family line of Jacob’s son Levi. All males in Levi’s tribe had special work to do. They took care of the holy tent and later the temple. Levites from Aaron’s family line served as priests (\k Aaron\k*, \k Priest\k*). The Levites didn’t receive land when the nation of Israel started living in Canaan. God provided for them from what the other tribes had.
\p \k Light\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word light. The first meaning is when the sun is shining and there is light outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that agree with God. Light includes things that show or do what God wants for his world. It includes peace, understanding, health and goodness. God’s light works to free God’s world from evil and evil spiritual beings (\k evil spiritual beings\k*). These are described as darkness (\k darkness\k*). The time when God rules as King is talked about as the kingdom of light.
\p \k Light for the Gentiles\k*\im Words that described the work of God’s servant (Isaiah 42:6 and Isaiah 49:6). The servant would make sure that God’s covenant and salvation reached all people groups. In the New Testament, Simeon understood that Jesus would do this work (Luke 2:30–32). Paul and Barnabas understood that they were to be light for the Gentiles too (Acts 13:47). They did this by sharing the message about Jesus with Gentiles. In Acts 26:23 Paul preached about how Jesus brought the message of God’s light. This is the message of salvation from the power of sin and death. Jesus brought this light to Jews and Gentiles. Jesus’ followers are to share Jesus’ light and salvation with the whole world.
\p \k Living water\k*\im A way of talking about how God provides everything that people need to live. In the Bible it’s also called water that gives life and the water of life. Water is living when it’s fresh and moving. People drink it to stay alive and plants and animals can live in it. Prophets described God as a spring of water that gave life to his people. They described him as a shepherd who led his people to springs of water. And they described how water would flow out of Jerusalem. This water would give life to the whole world. In the New Testament, Jesus described the Holy Spirit as living water. Jesus gives living water to people who believe in him. This means that he shares the Holy Spirit with them. The Spirit provides what their spirits need. This is like how water provides what their bodies need. The Spirit helps them serve others. This is how the living water flows out from inside of people. In Revelation, God offers the water of life freely to everyone who believes in him.
\p \k Lord\k*\im The name that the Israelites used to talk about God. In the Hebrew language the name is made up of the letters YHWH. No one knows exactly what this name means. These letters sound like the Hebrew words for I am who I am.
\p \k Lord Jesus Christ\k*\im A title for Jesus that describes him in many ways. As Lord, he has authority over all other rulers on earth. As Jesus, he is a Jew who lived in Israel when the Roman government was in control. Jesus is also God’s Son. As Christ, he is the Jewish Messiah and King. The title Lord Jesus Christ means that Jesus is the King of everything. It means he is the Saviour who rescues God’s people and the natural world. He rescues them from sin, death, and evil. It means he is worthy of worship because he is God.
\p \k Lord - Ruler\k*\im A title for a ruler, leader or master. It’s used as a title for God in the Bible. It means that God has authority over everything and everyone. In New Testament times, lord was used as a title for the Roman emperor. It meant that Caesar had authority everywhere that the Roman government was in control. Jesus’ followers called him Lord. This meant that they recognised that Jesus is God. They recognised that Jesus has complete authority over everything and everyone. Jesus’ followers challenged the authority of Caesar when they called Jesus Lord.
\p \k Lord’s Supper\k*\im The meal that Christians share together to remember Jesus’ death. It’s based on the last supper that Jesus shared with his disciples before he died. It’s also based on the Jewish Passover Feast. The meal includes eating bread and drinking wine. These remind believers that Jesus gave his body and his blood to save all people.
\p \k Lord’s day\k*\im What John the writer of Revelation called Sunday or the day after the Sabbath day. It’s the day of the week when Jesus was raised from the dead. Because of this, churches started gathering to worship God on Sundays.
\p \k Lot\k*\im The grandson of Terah and nephew of Abraham. He went with Abraham and Sarah when they travelled to Canaan to live. He chose to live in the valley of the River Jordan near Sodom. His wife died during the time when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. The Moabite and the Ammonite people groups were from Lot’s family line.
\p \k Love God\k*\im God created people to receive his love and to love him in return. God’s love changes people and makes them able to love him. Love for God is both a feeling and a choice that people act on. The action they take is to obey him. Love for God is shown by obeying his commandments. The Law of Moses in the Old Testament and Jesus in the New Testament teach this.

This meant that the blood was a witness against the murderer. It showed that justice needed to be done. The murderer had to be put to death. That brought justice back to the people and to the land. In the New Testament, Jesus taught that murder meant more than killing someone. Hating someone was as serious a sin as committing murder.

They were men from Aaron’s family line and served only the true God (\k Levites\k*, \k Aaron\k*). They served him in the holy tent and later in the temple. They made sacrifices for the people to God. They followed special laws to be clean and pure. This allowed them to touch holy things. It also allowed them to be close to God in the holy tent or temple. People who weren’t priests weren’t allowed to do those things. God also said that all Israelites were priests. This didn’t mean that they all served him in the holy tent or temple. It meant that every Israelite could know God closely. Every Israelite could serve and worship him.
\p \k Priests’ clothes\k*\im Special clothes the priests wore when they worked in the holy tent or temple. The clothes included outer robes, inner robes, underwear and a belt. They included a turban with a gold plate on it. The clothes for the high priest included a linen apron and a chest cloth. The chest cloth held the Urim and Thummim. These were special stones that helped the priest know what God wanted done. The priests’ clothes helped set the priests apart for their work for God.
\p \k Prophecies about Jesus\k*\im Many prophecies and promises recorded in the Old Testament point to Jesus. They show God’s plan to send a Saviour. This Saviour would rescue the world from the power of sin, death and evil. Apostles and writers in the New Testament studied these prophecies and promises. They understood that the prophecies and promises came true through Jesus’ life and work. Jesus completes the work that God had been doing through Israel for hundreds of years. Jesus is the Saviour God had promised to send (\k Saviour\k*).
\p \k Prophecy\k*\im An announcement about what God wants done or about what is going to happen. These messages come from God or God’s word. They are spoken by prophets and this is called prophesying. The prophecies of many prophets before the time of Jesus were written down. They were included in the Old Testament. All together they are called the Prophets. The Holy Spirit makes some people able to prophesy. The messages are to be shared in an orderly way that people can understand. They are shared to help people who don’t know God turn to God. They are shared to encourage people who already follow God. They are shared to help people understand how to obey God faithfully.
\p \k Prophet\k*\im A person God chooses to speak through. In the Old Testament prophets told their people or other nations a message from God. Prophets were advisors to the kings of Israel and Judah. They were to tell the king when he wasn’t being faithful to God. The prophecies of many prophets before the time of Jesus were written down. (\k False prophet\k*)
\p \k Prosperity gospel\k*\im A teaching that goes against the good news about Jesus. It teaches that God saves people from all problems and suffering on earth. It teaches that God gives riches to all who believe in Jesus and have faith in him. It teaches that they will always have more than they need. It also teaches that they will always have healthy bodies. It teaches that they will have all of these things while they are alive on earth. The good news about Jesus that is true doesn’t teach these things. What is true is that Jesus saves people from the power of sin, death and evil. This salvation begins while people are alive on earth. It will be complete when Jesus returns and rules as King in the new creation. Jesus is the example for his followers about how to live. His example teaches believers how to serve others and how to face suffering.
\p \k Prostitute\k*\im A person who has sex with others in exchange for payment of some kind. Some people are prostitutes because they have no other choice. This happens with slaves or people who live under someone else’s control. Some people choose to be prostitutes. It’s how they make money. Writers in the Bible talk about people who choose to be prostitutes. They are a sign for people or groups who try to make other people sin. They are also a sign for not being faithful to worship only God. Marriage is one way that the Bible describes God’s relationship with his people. When his people serve other gods, it’s like not being faithful in marriage. It’s like being a prostitute with false gods. God doesn’t want any human being to be a prostitute with their body. He also doesn’t want them to worship anything or anyone but him.
\p \k Proverb\k*\im A short and wise saying. Proverbs come to exist when a person or a community studies life in the world. As they study, they learn lessons and notice patterns. These patterns are about how life in the world works. The person or community puts these lessons and patterns into words like a short poem. Proverbs are passed down within families and communities for hundreds of years. A proverb isn’t a promise that life always works according to the pattern it describes.
\p \k Pure or impure\k*\im Ways that the Bible describes what is or isn’t acceptable to God. Things are considered pure when they are according to what God wants. Things are considered impure when they go against what God wants. People’s thoughts, words and actions can be pure or impure. The Bible also calls pure things clean and impure things unclean. The Holy Spirit lives among people who live in pure ways. People who live in impure ways can’t be near to God. In the Old Testament, God gave his people ways to be considered pure and clean. When Jesus came, his sacrifice on the cross made his followers pure. Jesus’ followers remain pure by following Jesus’ example for living. (\k Clean or unclean\k*)
\p \k Rabbi\k*\im A male Jewish teacher. Rabbis usually studied the Old Testament and other Jewish writings in schools. They were usually trained by other rabbis. People who wanted to learn from them and be like them would become their disciples. Usually only boys and men were disciples or students. Jesus was a rabbi even though he wasn’t trained like rabbis of his time. He welcomed both women and men as his students.
\p \k Rachel\k*\im The second daughter of Laban and second wife of Jacob. Leah was her sister and Bilhah was her servant. She was a shepherd. Jacob loved her more than he loved Leah. She became the mother of Joseph and Benjamin.
\p \k Rahab\k*\im A woman from the city of Jericho in Canaan. She worked as a prostitute. She hid the spies sent by Joshua and kept them safe. When the Israelites destroyed Jericho, they saved Rahab and her family. She became part of God’s people. David and Jesus were from her family line.
\p \k Rebekah\k*\im The daughter of Bethuel and sister of Laban from Mesopotamia. She married Isaac and became the mother of Jacob and Esau.
\p \k Red Sea\k*\im A large body of water at the border of Egypt during the time of the exodus. It isn’t known for sure which body of water this is today. God divided the water so the people of Israel could walk through on dry ground. After the Israelites reached the other side, the Egyptians drowned in the water.
\p \k Rehoboam\k*\im The son of Solomon and an Ammonite woman named Naamah. While Rehoboam was king, the nation of Israel divided into two kingdoms. Rehoboam ruled over the southern kingdom of Judah. He was a foolish leader who did evil things and worshipped false gods. He didn’t have the wealth or power that Solomon had.
\p \k Repent\k*\im To turn away from sin and turn towards God. This isn’t done only one time in someone’s life. Every time someone sins, God wants them to turn towards him. God has grace and forgives them. This heals their relationship with God. For many years the Israelites offered sacrifices to show that they had repented. In the New Testament, people showed that they repented by asking for forgiveness, trusting in Jesus and following him. (\k Right with God\k*)
\p \k Rest\k*\im In the Bible there are many meanings for the word rest. The first meaning is talked about in \xt Genesis 2\xt*. After God finished his work of creating the world, he rested. There was peace between God and what he created. Everything that existed had what it needed to live like God wanted it to. Another meaning is talked about in the Ten Commandments. It’s the Sabbath rest. On the seventh day of the week, Israelites were to rest instead of working. Another meaning is talked about in \xt Psalm 95\xt*. It’s the rest the Israelites had after they were freed from slavery. God brought them to the land he promised to give them. The full meaning is talked about in \xt Hebrews 3-4\xt*. Jesus brings true rest to those who believe in him. They begin to enjoy Jesus’ rest when they start following him. They will enjoy it fully when he rules completely as King.
\p \k Resurrection\k*\im Rising from the dead to live again. Jews disagreed about whether or not there would be a resurrection after people died. Jesus brought some people back to life again after they had died. Yet those people didn’t live for ever. They died again later on. That isn’t what happened to Jesus. In Jesus’ resurrection, God raised him from the dead to live for ever. He never died again. God will one day bring all people who have died back to life.
\p \k Reuben\k*\im The eldest son of Jacob and Leah. In the Hebrew language the name Reuben means look a son. It sounds like the word for he has seen my suffering. Reuben had sex with his father’s concubine Bilhah. Because of that, he wasn’t allowed to have the rights of being Jacob’s eldest son. His family line became a tribe of Israel.
\p \k Right with God\k*\im Being able to live in peace and joy with God. This is also called being made righteous or being justified. It means that people can enjoy the blessings of God’s covenant. It also means that people can be freed from the power of sin, death and evil. God frees them through Jesus’ death and resurrection. People who trust in God and have faith in him are made right with him.
\p \k River Euphrates\k*\im A river that flows through the countries now called Turkey, Syria and Iraq. It was an important river in the kingdoms of Babylonia and Persia. In Jesus’ time, the Euphrates formed one of the borders of the Roman government’s lands.
\p \k River Jordan\k*\im The biggest river in the land of Israel. It flows north to south from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea.
\p \k River Nile\k*\im The longest river in Africa. It flows through the northeastern part of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea. The soil around the Nile is very rich and good for farming.
\p \k Roman citizen\k*\im Being a citizen of Rome gave people certain rights. It protected them from being treated badly in certain ways. Roman rulers had to follow Roman laws about citizens. Most of the people in lands controlled by the Roman government weren’t Roman citizens. Being a Roman citizen was special.
\p \k Rome\k*\im A kingdom in the area around the Mediterranean Sea that lasted for hundreds of years. The capital city was also called Rome. It became a powerful government that ruled over many other nations and people groups. It ruled over Israel during the times of the New Testament. For many years it was led by powerful emperors. The Roman government treated many of Jesus’ followers badly.
\p \k Rulers\k*\im God wanted everything he created to live and to work together in peace and joy. Human beings are to make sure that this happens. God is the ruler over all creation. He set human beings apart as rulers over plants, animals, the land and the seas. This is one way that God created human beings to be like himself. As rulers, humans are to fill the earth and to bring it under control. This doesn’t mean that humans can use God’s earth however they want to. It means that they are to take care of everything on earth. They are to help everything be the way God wants it to be. Humans do this by following God’s example of ruling. God showed himself to be a ruler who blesses, honours and protects what he has made. Jesus showed that God is a ruler who gives everything to serve and to bless others. When human beings don’t follow God’s example of ruling, the earth suffers.
\p \k Ruth\k*\im A woman from Moab and the daughter-in-law of Naomi. When her husband died, she left Moab and went to Israel with Naomi. She married an Israelite named Boaz and became the great-grandmother of David.
\p \k Sabbath day\k*\im The seventh day of the week for Israelites and Jews. It was a holy day when they rested and didn’t work. This included their livestock, their servants and outsiders who lived with them. It was a day to honour how God rested after creating the world. It also honoured the rest God promised the Israelites after freeing them from slavery in Egypt. The Sabbath day was a sign of God’s covenant with the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The day was a reminder that God is good and provides what his people need. Later, Jewish religious leaders made many rules about what was allowed on the Sabbath day. These rules didn’t always help people honour God. Jesus taught people how to honour God on the Sabbath day. Even though the leaders opposed him, he performed miracles on the Sabbath day.
\p \k Sacrifice\k*\im Something given to God as an offering. It’s one way to worship God. God’s instructions in the Law of Moses taught his people to make sacrifices to him. They would offer to God their animals, crops and other things that they owned. They would bring them to the holy tent or the temple. Some sacrifices were sin offerings to pay for people’s sins. That is how they would be forgiven and made right with God. Other sacrifices were to thank God for his blessings. In the New Testament, Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice. He gave up his life as a sin offering to pay for people’s sins. His sacrifice makes people who believe in him right with God. Jesus’ followers show they are thankful for his sacrifice by giving up many things. As they continue Jesus’ work on earth, they give up money and things they own. They give up things they hope to do or to have. They may even give up their lives. They offer everything they have to God because they trust him and love him. They make sacrifices to do what is good for others.
\p \k Sacrifice animals\k*\im A certain way of putting animals to death. This was done in order to worship and honour someone or a god. This practice was common in the times and places recorded in the Bible. Followers of the true God sacrificed animals to show that they were turning away from sin. The animal’s death was a sign of the death and harm that sin brings. It was also a sign of the punishment for sins that human beings commit. Animals were killed instead of human beings. In this way animals were sacrificed to pay for people’s sins. People who worshiped false gods sacrificed animals for different reasons. They would do this to show how committed they were to their false gods. They would do it to get a blessing. They would do it because they thought the false gods were hungry or were angry.
\p \k Sacrifice children\k*\im To kill children as a way of worshipping and honouring false gods. People would sacrifice children to show how committed they were to the false gods. They would also do it to get a blessing from the false gods. This practice was common in the times and places recorded in the Old Testament. The true God showed that he wasn’t to be worshipped that way. God’s laws make it very clear that human beings aren’t to be sacrificed. This includes children. \xt Leviticus 18-20\xt* talk about this.
\p \k Sadducees\k*\im The group of Jewish religious leaders with the most authority in Jerusalem. This was during the times of the New Testament. They were in charge of the temple and worked closely with the Roman rulers. They didn’t believe in angels or that God raised people from the dead. They didn’t believe that Jesus was the Messiah God had promised to send. Most Sadducees opposed Jesus and his teachings.
\p \k Safe cities\k*\im Six cities where Levites lived. Three were on the east side of the River Jordan. Three were on the west side. People who had accidentally killed someone could go there. They would be safe and wouldn’t be killed by the dead person’s nearest male relative. They could live there until the high priest died. Then they could go back to where they had lived before.
\p \k Salvation\k*\im When God comes and rescues his people. Over hundreds of years God slowly showed his plan for salvation. The Israelites and Jews had been waiting for God to save them. They waited for him to save them once and for all from their enemies. They thought that their enemies were human armies or people who treated them badly. But God is committed to saving all that he created. He will save it from the power of sin, death and evil. This includes all people who trust in him. This became clear when Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead. When people believe in Jesus, he rescues them from the power of sin, death and evil. This is the beginning of their salvation. Everyone who believes in Jesus is saved for ever. Salvation will be complete when Jesus returns to earth. (\k Believe in\k*)
\p \k Samaria\k*\im The capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel. Omri made Samaria the centre of the northern kingdom’s government. Ahab made it the centre of the northern kingdom’s worship practices. The Assyrians took control of the city and the area around it in 722 BC. They brought other people groups to live there. These people groups mixed with the Israelites who were left in Samaria. Their children became known as Samaritans. In the time of the Romans, Samaria was an area of Israel. It was between Galilee in the north and Judea in the south. In Jesus’ time, the Samaritans claimed to be from Abraham’s family line. Jews and Samaritans usually treated each other like enemies.
\p \k Samson\k*\im One of the 12 judges of Israel. He was from the tribe of Dan and his father was Manoah. The angel of the Lord appeared to his mother to announce his birth. He was to live as a Nazirite his entire life. God used Samson to free the Israelites from being treated badly by the Philistines.
\p \k Samuel\k*\im An Israelite who served God’s people as a prophet, a priest and a judge. In the Hebrew language the name Samuel means to be heard by God. The name can also mean borrowed from God. Samuel was faithful to God his entire life. He was the son of Elkanah and Hannah. He was from the tribe of Levi through the family line of Korah. His sons were Joel and Abijah. Samuel was raised as a Nazirite in the holy tent at Shiloh. He started serving the Israelites as a prophet when he was young. He served as a priest after Eli died. When he served as judge God freed the Israelites from the Philistines. Samuel anointed first Saul and then David as king.
\p \k Sanhedrin\k*\im A group of 70 religious leaders. They had the most authority in Jewish courts in Jesus’ time. The Sanhedrin was also called the Jewish Council. They looked after the temple in Jerusalem and made important decisions for the Jewish people. Both Pharisees and Sadducees served in the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin opposed Jesus. They also opposed the apostles who spread the news about Jesus being raised from the dead.
\p \k Sarah\k*\im A woman from Mesopotamia who was Abraham’s wife. She was the daughter of Terah but from a different mother than Abraham. God changed Sarai’s name to Sarah in \xt Genesis 17\xt*. In the Hebrew language, Sarai and Sarah both mean princess or noble woman. For many years she was unable to have children. God promised that she would have a son. When she was very old, she gave birth to Isaac.
\p \k Sardis\k*\im An important city in the Roman territory of Asia. There was a temple to the goddess Artemis there.
\p \k Saul\k*\im Israel’s first king. He was the son of Kish and was from the tribe of Benjamin. He was very tall and handsome. As king, he stopped trusting and obeying God. Because of this, his family line didn’t continue to rule in Israel. Saul was controlled by fear and jealousy. He tried very hard to kill David. He died in a battle against the Philistines.
\p \k Saviour\k*\im God saved the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. He saved them from their enemies many times throughout the Old Testament. He was the only one powerful enough to save them. In these ways he showed himself to be their only Saviour. He also promised to send a Saviour who would live among them. This was Jesus the Messiah. Jesus saves those who believe in him and follow him. He saves them from the power of sin, death and evil.
\p \k Sea\k*\im Many stories in the Bible describe the sea as something to be feared. It was something people needed God to save them from. This included the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. It included Jonah when he was tossed into the sea. It included Jesus when he calmed the storm on the sea. It included John’s vision in Revelation of the beast who came from the sea.
\p \k Seal\k*\im There are several meanings for the word seal in the Bible. The first meaning is to close something up or shut it. The second is to put into effect an agreement or covenant. The third meaning is a piece of sticky wax. People would put the wax on important scrolls or papers to close them. Only people with permission were supposed to break the seal and open the papers. The last meaning is an official or royal mark that shows who someone is. A seal that was pressed onto papers or other things left its mark on them. This showed that the person agreed to something or that it belonged to them.
\p \k Second death\k*\im A way of describing God’s final judgement against those who refuse to follow him. They are destroyed and are separated from God for ever. John described the place where the second death took place as a lake of fire. It was also called a lake of burning sulphur. Those who were thrown into it would have no part in God’s kingdom on earth.
\p \k Servants\k*\im Israelites were allowed to work as servants for other Israelites. This was to help them pay off debts they owed. After six years of working, they were given the choice to be set free. If they chose to be set free they were given food and livestock. The servant could also choose to continue working for the same family their entire life. Servants weren’t to be treated badly or considered slaves. This was because God had freed them from slavery in Egypt. They were never to be slaves again. Being slaves again was one of the covenant curses.
\p \k Set apart\k*\im In the Old Testament there were two meanings for being set apart. The first meaning was for people, priests, prophets and things that were set apart. People, priests and prophets could be set apart to serve God in special ways. Things like animals, land and objects could also be set apart for the Lord. This meant that they weren’t used in the normal way. They were to be used only in special ways to serve God. The second meaning was when people or things were set apart to be destroyed. This was a way that God brought judgement against people’s evil deeds.
\p \k Seth\k*\im A son of Adam and Eve. He was like Adam in ways that Cain wasn’t. He followed God. God chose to work through Seth’s family line in his plan for saving the world. Jesus was from Seth’s family line.
\p \k Seven\k*\im The number used in the Bible to talk about things that are complete. It shows that things are finished and perfect.
\p \k Shame and honour\k*\im In the times and places of the Bible, shame and honour were very important. People wanted to avoid bringing shame to their family, their community and their people group. Everyone in a community understood what ways of speaking and acting were considered proper. Going against those ways was like saying no to their relationship with their community. This brought shame. Then that person wasn’t respected. They would often run away or hide. Someone with more authority could bring that person back into the community. This was how the shame was taken away. Instead, people wanted to bring honour to their family, community and people group. Honour came by doing things that were considered proper and worthy of respect. The more honour someone had the more authority they had in the community.
\p \k Shechem\k*\im A city in Canaan that became an important city in Israel. Abraham and Jacob built altars to God there. Shechem was also the name of the man who raped Dinah. Dinah’s brothers killed Shechem and the men in the city because of what Shechem did.
\p \k Shem\k*\im The second son of Noah. He and his wife were saved from the flood because they were in the ark. He treated his father with respect when Noah got drunk after the flood. Shem followed God. Noah recognised Shem as the leader among his brothers. He spoke a blessing over Shem’s family.
\p \k Shema\k*\im A Jewish prayer that includes Deuteronomy 6:4. In the Hebrew language, the first word of Deuteronomy 6:4 is shema. It means to listen and to take action based on what was heard. In the Hebrew language, hearing and doing are understood to be the same thing. The Shema explains what God’s covenant with the Israelites was about. God is the one and only true God. The Israelites were to obey only God. This was true for each person. It was also true for them as a community. They were to obey the Ten Commandments and all of God’s laws. Many things would help them remember who God is and what he commanded. They were to talk about his commands all the time everywhere and with everyone. They were to write them down. They were to place reminders on their clothes, their bodies, their houses and their gates. They were to ask questions about God freely and talk about him with their children. Jesus used the words of the Shema in Mark 12:29.
\p \k Shepherd\k*\im Someone who takes care of sheep or other livestock. In the Old Testament Abraham and many in his family line were shepherds. They travelled from one place to another to find grass for their flocks. It’s also a way to talk about leaders who take care of other people. Israel’s leaders were often described as being bad shepherds. God was the good shepherd for his people. In the New Testament, church leaders are to be shepherds of Jesus’ followers. Jesus himself is the good shepherd of God’s people.
\p \k Shiloh\k*\im An important Israelite city in the hill country of Ephraim. It was north of Jerusalem. Joshua set up the holy tent there when the Israelites entered Canaan.
\p \k Sihon and Og\k*\im Two Amorite kings who lived east of the River Jordan. Sihon was the king of Heshbon and Og was the king of Bashan. The Israelites asked for permission to travel through their lands in peace. Sihon and Og attacked them but the Israelites won the battles. Some of the Israelite tribes chose to remain and live in those lands.
\p \k Silas\k*\im A leader among the believers in Jerusalem. He worked with Paul, Barnabas and Peter. He was a prophet and a Roman citizen. He helped take an important letter from the Jerusalem church to Gentile churches. He also helped Paul and Peter write letters to churches.
\p \k Siloam\k*\im A place inside the walls of Jerusalem where there was a pool of fresh water. Siloam means sent. The first pool there was built by King Hezekiah. The Babylonians destroyed it but it was rebuilt in Nehemiah’s time. Water from the pool was poured on the altar during the Feast of Booths. The pool’s water came from the Gihon spring. There was also a tower there that fell during Jesus’ time and killed 18 people.
\p \k Simon of Cyrene\k*\im A man from Cyrene who carried part of Jesus’ cross. Roman soldiers made him do this. Cyrene was in the country now called Libya in Africa. Many Jews who spoke the Greek language lived there. They would travel to Jerusalem for Jewish feasts. Simon’s sons were named Alexander and Rufus. This Rufus might be the same Rufus Paul talked about in Romans 16:13.
\p \k Sin\k*\im Thoughts, words, actions or desires that go against what God wants. These are harmful to the person, to others and to the rest of creation. Sin came into the world when Adam and Eve disobeyed God. Sin destroyed the peace between God and human beings. It destroyed the peace between human beings and the peace between everything that God made. Sin brings death. It keeps human beings separated from God. The Bible describes sin as a master and human beings as its slaves. Sin is evil. Jesus is the only one powerful enough to destroy the power of sin. Only Jesus can free humans from it.
\p \k Sin offerings\k*\im Sacrifices or offerings that God required his people to make when they sinned without meaning to. When people realised that they had sinned, they had to stop. They had to turn back to God and trust him to forgive them. They would show this by making a sin offering. Sacrificing an animal was a way to pay for the sin the person had done. The offering could be bulls, goats, lambs, doves, pigeons or fine flour. God required sin offerings to be made as soon as the sin was noticed. They were also to be made at a certain time of the year. Most sin offerings were eaten by priests inside the courtyard of the holy tent or temple. Other sin offerings were to be burnt completely. Parts of them were burnt on the altar. Other parts were burnt outside the camp or the city. When Jesus sacrificed himself on the cross, he paid for the sins of all people. He was the last sin offering needed.
\p \k Slaves\k*\im Many people worked as slaves in the times and places recorded in the Bible. The way of life of many people groups depended on the work done by slaves. Slaves could do nearly every job in a household. Writers of the Bible didn’t teach people to have slaves. Old Testament writers taught how slaves and masters were to treat one another. This was based on the Law of Moses. All slaves among the people of Israel were allowed to rest on the Sabbath day. They were allowed to worship God along with free people. They weren’t required to stay slaves until they died. God’s people weren’t to be sold as slaves. New Testament writers taught that slaves and masters were equal members of God’s family. They were to serve Jesus and to serve one another. There is also a spiritual meaning for slavery in the Bible. Writers of the Bible described human beings as being slaves to sin. This means that sin rules over all human beings and controls them. Jesus frees people from being slaves to sin.
\p \k Smyrna\k*\im An important city in the Roman territory of Asia. It was on the coast of the Aegean Sea. It’s part of the city Izmir in the country now known as Turkey.
\p \k Sodom and Gomorrah\k*\im Two cities in Canaan. The people who lived there were known for doing evil things. Abraham’s nephew Lot lived in Sodom. God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah but saved Lot. God destroyed these cities because of their evil ways.
\p \k Solomon\k*\im The son of David and Bathsheba who became king of Israel. God gave him the name Jedidiah. In the Hebrew language Jedidiah means loved by the Lord. This name showed that God had chosen Solomon to be king after David. Solomon was the king when the temple was built in Jerusalem. He was very wise and very rich. He wrote many proverbs and songs. Later in his rule Solomon stopped being faithful to God. This led to the nation of Israel separating into two kingdoms.
\p \k Son of David\k*\im A name used for Jesus to show that he was Israel’s true King and Messiah. God had promised King David that his kingdom would last for ever. This would happen because someone from his family line would be the messiah. Jesus was the promised ruler from David’s family. (\k David\k* 1 Samuel 16:1 – 17:58.)
\p \k Son of God\k*\im A way that Psalm 2 described Israel’s kings. It showed that they were chosen by God to rule and were worthy of honour. It showed that they were to follow God’s example for ruling. In New Testament times, Roman emperors were called son of god. This was because they believed that the Roman gods gave Caesar his power. The name was used in a special way to talk about Jesus. It means that the one, true, mighty God is Jesus’ Father. Using this name for Jesus made Jews who didn’t accept him very angry. It also made the Roman government angry because it challenged Caesar’s authority.
\p \k Son of Man\k*\im A way to talk about a person or human being. It’s also the name of someone in a vision Daniel had (Daniel 7:13–14). In the vision, the son of man saved Israel from their enemies. Jesus called himself the Son of Man. This was a way to talk about how he is human and has God’s authority. Jesus explained that as the Son of Man he would suffer. Then he would win victory over God’s enemies. Those enemies are sin, death and evil. Jesus would do this for all human beings.
\p \k Sons of God\k*\im It isn’t known for sure who the sons of God were. It’s thought that they were spiritual beings that turned against God. It’s thought that they came to earth with bodies and married human women. This went against God’s plan for human beings to marry only human beings.
\p \k Southern kingdom\k*\im The land and tribes of Israel ruled over by kings from David’s family line. It was also called Judah. It included the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and some Israelites from other tribes. Important cities in the southern kingdom were Hebron, Lachish and Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the capital city. The southern kingdom began when Rehoboam lost authority over ten of the tribes. It ended in 586 BC when Babylon took control of Jerusalem. Some people from the southern kingdom returned after being exiled in Babylon. Prophets to the southern kingdom included Joel, Isaiah, Micah, Zephaniah, Jeremiah, Habakkuk and Ezekiel. The kings were Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah, Athaliah (queen), Joash, Amaziah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. Only a few of these kings were faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. This included Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joash, Amaziah, Uzziah, Jotham, Hezekiah and Josiah.
\p \k Spain\k*\im A country in the western area of the lands ruled by the Roman government. Today it’s still called Spain. Paul wanted to share the good news there. It’s the area furthest west that is mentioned in the Bible.
\p \k Speak other languages\k*\im When people speak out loud in a language they didn’t know before. The Holy Spirit has given some believers the ability to do this. Others listening to them may or may not speak the language. Unless someone can explain the message, believers with this gift should speak only with God. Doing this will help them be close to God through prayer. (\k Explain other languages\k*)
\p \k Special water\k*\im Water was used in many practices to help the Israelites worship God. Priests washed their hands and feet with water when they served God at the altar. This water was held in a large bronze bowl. People and things that were considered unclean became clean after being washed in water. It was considered special when priests added ashes from a young cow to water. This special water was sprinkled on people or things after being near a dead body. Using water in these ways meant more than cleaning off dirt. It was a sign that people or things were considered spiritually clean and pure. Only people or things that were considered clean and pure could be close to God.
\p \k Spiritual\k*\im Something that has to do with the spirit of a human being or a spiritual being. Throughout the Bible there are many meanings for the word spirit. One meaning is God’s Spirit or the Holy Spirit. Another meaning is spiritual beings. Another meaning is the spirit of a person. When God created human beings he breathed life into them. This life from God is each person’s spirit. It’s the part of each person that exists as more than a body. It will exist for ever. Things that happen in a person’s spirit or to their spirit are described as spiritual. A person’s spirit is often understood to be like their heart or their soul.
\p \k Spiritual armour\k*\im Tools that God gives his people to protect them from evil. These tools can’t be held in people’s hands. They are spiritual. They are described as armour or weapons because believers use them in spiritual fights. Truth, godliness, peace, faith, salvation, God’s word and prayer are kinds of spiritual armour. These tools help believers to be strong in their faith. They help them to follow Jesus faithfully and to say no to evil.
\p \k Spiritual beings\k*\im Beings that don’t have bodies like the bodies of humans or other creatures on earth. They are also called heavenly beings. They can look like humans even though they don’t have human bodies. God is a spiritual being. He created all other spiritual beings. (\k Angel\k*)
\p \k Spiritual blessings\k*\im Ways that God blesses his people spiritually. These blessings aren’t something that people can hold in their hands. They are the riches in heaven that Jesus talked about (Matthew 6:19–21). There are many kinds of spiritual blessings. Wisdom, understanding, grace, hope and love are spiritual blessings. Being forgiven for sin and having eternal life are also spiritual blessings. People don’t earn spiritual blessings. God gives them freely.
\p \k Spiritual fight\k*\im The battle of the devil and all evil spiritual beings against God. They want to stop God’s plan for the world. One way they do this is by trying to make people turn against God. The fight occurs in the heavenly world. Humans are part of the fight through the choices they make. They make choices about who to worship and how to treat others. Worshipping God and acting according to his plan is how they fight against evil.
\p \k Stephen\k*\im One of the seven leaders chosen by the believers in Jerusalem to be a deacon. He made sure all the believers had enough food. Many Jews were angry that he preached about Jesus. They killed him by throwing stones at him. He was the first of Jesus’ followers to be killed for being faithful to Jesus.
\p \k Stoics\k*\im A group of thinkers who followed the teachings of the Greek thinker Zeno of Citium. They believed that people should live according to natural laws called the logos. The logos was understood to be the force of reason that made the world work. Paul shared the good news about Jesus with Stoics in Athens.
\p \k Stone tablets\k*\im Pieces of stone that Moses carved out of rock. God wrote on them the words of the Ten Commandments and the covenant law. They were the written copy of the covenant agreement between God and the Israelites. Moses broke the first set of tablets. He broke them when the Israelites worshipped the metal statue of the calf. Later God wrote the covenant agreement on two new tablets. These were kept in the ark of the covenant.
\p \k Stories\k*\im It was very important to the Israelites to remember stories and teachings. They told the stories of what happened among their people from long ago. They told the stories about God’s mighty works. They also told the stories about the laws and teachings they had received from God. Older people told these things to younger people. In this way everyone learnt the stories and teachings that were important to the community.
\p \k Stubborn\k*\im A way to describe people who refuse to listen to God or obey him. The Bible gives examples of people who choose to be this way. It also talks about God making people stubborn. This happened with Pharaoh during the exodus. It also happened when the Canaanites attacked Joshua’s army. This doesn’t mean that God causes certain people not to believe in him. Pharaoh and the Canaanite armies had shown that they refused to believe in God. They were determined to stop what God wanted done. But God made sure that what he wanted to be done was done. He used how stubborn they were as a way of accomplishing his purposes and plans.
\p \k Super-apostle\k*\im What Paul called certain Jewish leaders. These leaders opposed his work in the churches he helped start. Compared to Paul, they seemed strong, successful, healthy and rich. They told lies about Paul and claimed that he was always causing trouble. They took advantage of new believers and didn’t serve people with love. They pretended to serve God but were really serving Satan by doing evil.
\p \k Susa\k*\im One of the capital cities of the Persian government. It was located east of the River Tigris in the country now called Iran.
\p \k Sword\k*\im A sharp weapon used for fighting. Writers in the Bible said the words people speak are like swords. This showed how people can cause harm with their words. Writers in the Bible also said God’s word is like a sword. This showed that God’s word uncovers what is inside people’s hearts. It also showed that God’s word strengthens and protects believers when they struggle against evil. In a special way, the words from Jesus’ mouth were described as a sword. This was a picture of how Jesus is God’s word. Everything he speaks is the truth about God. Speaking truth about God is how he destroys the devil’s lies about God.
\p \k Synagogue\k*\im Places where Jews in New Testament times would gather to worship God. They would read out loud from the Law of Moses and the Prophets. Then Jewish teachers called rabbis would teach the people. This would happen on the Sabbath day. There were synagogues throughout the lands controlled by the Roman government.
\p \k Tamar\k*\im The daughter-in-law of Judah. Her first two husbands were Judah’s sons but they both died. After that, Judah slept with Tamar without knowing who she was. She got pregnant and had twin sons. Jesus is from the family line of Tamar’s son Perez. This is a different Tamar than the daughter of King David.
\p \k Tamar - David\k*\im The daughter of David and Makaah. She and Absalom had the same parents. She and Amnon had the same father. Amnon raped Tamar when she was a virgin. Then he threw her out of his house. In those days, this was the same as divorcing her. Being raped and then not married brought shame to Tamar in their community. It meant she probably wouldn’t get married or have a family of her own. She lived with Absalom after that happened.
\p \k Tax collector\k*\im Jews in Jesus’ time who collected money for the Roman government. Many tax collectors weren’t honest. They made people give them more money than was required. The tax collectors would keep the extra money for themselves. Most Jews hated tax collectors for doing this. They hated tax collectors for working for the Romans. Tax collectors were often treated like outsiders. (\k Outsiders\k*)
\p \k Taxes\k*\im Money that a government requires people to pay. Those who live under the authority of that government pay this money. The leaders are supposed to use the money to take care of their people.
\p \k Teach their children\k*\im Israelite children were encouraged to ask questions about God and about worship practices. Parents were to explain to their children why they worshipped God in certain ways. This way the children would learn about who God is. They would learn about the mighty works that God does in the world. This was important because God had promised to be their God for ever. He wanted everyone in Jacob’s family line to know him.
\p \k Teachers of the law\k*\im Jewish men who had studied the Old Testament and other Jewish writings. These men taught what they had learnt to the people. People usually thought highly of these teachers and treated them with honour. Most teachers of the law opposed Jesus and his work.
\p \k Temple\k*\im The building in Jerusalem where people could go to worship God. It was also called the house of the Lord or the house of God. The first one was built when Solomon was king. God was present with his people there. The Babylonians destroyed it in the year 586 BC. Many years later, the Jews built another one. After the Romans destroyed that temple in the year AD 70, the Jews never built another one. Jesus called the temple his Father’s house. Jesus said his body was the new temple. This was because God was present with his people through Jesus. God remains present on earth through those who follow Jesus. They are filled with the Holy Spirit. Because of this, believers are described as a new temple.
\p \k Ten Commandments\k*\im The first laws that God gave Moses on Mount Sinai. God wrote them on stone tablets. They were the rules for God’s covenant with the people of Israel. The rest of the laws in the Old Testament were based on them. They are recorded in Exodus 20:3–17 and Deuteronomy 5:7–21. (\k Law of Moses\k*)
\p \k Ten plagues\k*\im Ten ways that God brought judgement against Pharaoh, Egypt and the Egyptian false gods. They were mighty signs worked by God through Moses and Aaron. These signs showed Pharaoh, the Israelites and the earth God’s authority and power over everything. They showed that God uses his authority and power to help his people. The plagues were part of how God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt. God sent one plague each time that Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites leave Egypt. The plagues included water turning into blood, frogs, gnats and flies. They included livestock being killed and boils on the skin of animals and people. They included hail, locusts and darkness. During the last plague, the eldest son in every Egyptian family was killed. God saved the Israelites from the suffering that the plagues brought.
\p \k Tent of meeting\k*\im A tent outside the Israelite camp near Mount Sinai. God met with Moses and the Israelites there through the pillar of cloud. Certain women served at the entrance and Joshua stayed in the tent all the time. After the holy tent was built the tent of meeting was no longer used. But the holy tent was also called the tent of meeting.
\p \k Tenth\k*\im The Israelites were to offer a tenth of everything they had to God. This included everything their land produced and their livestock. This would help them remember that everything belongs to God. It would help them remember that everything they had was a gift from God. It would help them be full of joy in the land God gave them. They gave the tenth of everything to God by sharing it with the priests and Levites. They also shared it with poor and needy people. The practice of giving God a tenth of everything lasted for hundreds of years. It’s also called giving a tithe. Many Christians give a tithe to their church. The tithe can be of anything their work produces including money.
\p \k Test\k*\im Times when people must make a difficult choice. They must choose between obeying God or doing what they want to do. The choice they make shows if they trust God to provide what they need. The purpose behind the test isn’t to cause people to make mistakes or for them to suffer. The purpose is for them to receive more of God’s grace. God tests people to help their faith in him grow stronger.
\p \k Theophilus\k*\im The person that Luke wrote his gospel and the book of \xt Acts\xt* for. The name Theophilus means lover of God. What Luke wrote can help anyone who loves God. Luke might have used the name Theophilus to talk about another Christian. He might have done this to keep the person’s name a secret to protect them. Luke called Theophilus most excellent. This might mean that Theophilus was an official of the Roman government.
\p \k Thessalonica\k*\im A Greek city the Roman territory of Macedonia. It was in the area that is now northern Greece. Paul travelled there on his second journey. His letters to the Thessalonians were written to the church there.
\p \k Thomas\k*\im One of Jesus’ 12 disciples. He was also called Didymus which means twin.
\p \k Three men\k*\im Three men with human bodies visited Abraham. They ate a meal that Abraham and Sarah prepared. They told Abraham and Sarah that Isaac would be born within a year. They talked with Abraham about God’s plans to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. Two of these men were angels. They continued travelling to Sodom and Gomorrah to destroy the cities and to save Lot. The other man was God. God is a spiritual being. He can appear to human beings. He can appear in a way that they see him and recognise who he is.
\p \k Thyatira\k*\im An important town in the Roman territory of Asia. It’s part of the city Akhisar in the country now known as Turkey. Lydia was from Thyatira.
\p \k Timothy\k*\im A young man from Lystra who worked with Paul. His father was a Greek Gentile. Because his mother was a Jew, Timothy was considered a Jew. His grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice were believers. Paul trusted Timothy and loved him like a son. Timothy served in many of the churches Paul helped start. He was with Paul when the apostle wrote many of his letters. The New Testament includes two letters Paul wrote to Timothy.
\p \k Titus\k*\im A man who worked and travelled with Paul. He was a Greek Gentile believer who wasn’t circumcised. He served in many of the churches that Paul helped start. He was an important leader in the church on the island of Crete. He also helped take the offering given by the Corinthian believers to Jerusalem. The New Testament book called Titus is a letter that Paul wrote to him.
\p \k Treated badly\k*\im Many of Jesus’ disciples and followers in the first churches were treated badly or killed. Other Jews made them suffer for following Jesus as the Jewish Messiah. These Jews wanted Christian Jews to return to the Jewish faith and way of life. Roman authorities made them suffer for following Jesus as King of the whole world. They wanted Christians to recognise that the Roman emperor was king (\k Rome\k* Matthew 8:1–17). The Roman government had laws that allowed people to practice the Jewish faith. But in the time of the first churches it didn’t have laws about Christians. This meant that Christians could get in trouble for following Jesus. To avoid trouble, they could go back to living as Jews. This was one way to escape being treated badly. It was very tempting for Christians who were suffering. Many Christians are still treated badly for faithfully following Jesus.
\p \k Tree of life\k*\im A tree in the Garden of Eden. Its fruit allowed people to live for ever. Human beings weren’t allowed to eat from it after Adam and Eve sinned. Ezekiel saw trees like the tree of life in his vision of the temple (Ezekiel 47:12). In Revelation, John saw this tree in the new heaven and the new earth (Revelation 22:2). Everyone who lived in God’s Holy City could eat of it freely. This meant that they had eternal life and lived for ever with God.
\p \k Tree of the knowledge\k*\im This was the tree of the knowledge of good and of evil. It was in the middle of the Garden of Eden. It was the only tree that Adam and Eve weren’t allowed to eat from. This is because only God knows and decides what is good and what is evil. Human beings aren’t allowed to decide about that.
\p \k Trinity\k*\im There is only one real and true God. The one and only God is three persons. This is the Trinity. The three persons are God the Father (\k God\k*, \k Father\k*), Jesus the Son (\k Jesus\k*, \k Son of God\k*) and the Holy Spirit (\k Holy Spirit\k*).
\p \k Trumpets\k*\im In the Bible, trumpets were used for many purposes. They were used in worship services and feasts and in battles. Trumpets were used to make important announcements and as alarms. Before the Israelites reached Canaan, trumpet blasts let the 12 tribes know when to start marching. In the New Testament, Jesus and Paul talked about trumpets being blown. Trumpets would announce when God gathered his people and raised them from the dead. In Revelation, angels blew trumpets to announce parts of God’s judgement against evil.
\p \k Tyre and Sidon\k*\im Cities on the Mediterranean coast in the country now called Lebanon. The Phoenician people lived there first. The cities were later controlled by many different governments. The Israelites never took control of these cities when they moved into Canaan. Tyre was also a strong fort. There was peace between Tyre and Israel during the rule of some of Israel’s kings. The people in Tyre and Sidon worshipped false gods and were known for doing evil things.
\p \k Ungodly people\k*\im People who don’t live the way God wants human beings to live. They don’t love, worship and obey God. They worship false gods. They try to get what is best for themselves and don’t serve others. They also try to make others stop being faithful to God and his ways. God wants ungodly people to turn away from sin and be made right with him. God will raise ungodly people from the dead. He will judge them.
\p \k Uriah\k*\im The husband of Bathsheba and one of David’s 30 chief warriors. He was a Hittite. He was an outsider who was considered part of Israel. David had him murdered in the battle against the Ammonites at Rabbah.
\p \k Vision\k*\im When God shows human beings something in the heavenly world (\k heavenly world\k*). Visions from God always agree with the truth about who God is. They are one way that God makes himself and his plans known to people. He appears to people and shows them something about who he is. He may also give them a message in the vision. The message may be just for the person who has the vision. Or God may want them to share the message with others. God can also send angels to appear to people in a vision. Visions can occur through dreams when people are asleep. People don’t make visions from God happen. They are a gift from God. Some visions are from the devil and evil spiritual beings. Those visions are harmful and don’t show the truth about who God is. Some people pretend to have visions. They do this to trick others with teachings that aren’t true.
\p \k Way of Jesus\k*\im A name for the practice of following Jesus. This name was used in Acts to describe how the community of believers lived.
\p \k Wisdom\k*\im Skill, ability, knowledge and understanding about something. Wisdom from God includes good sense and being able to tell right from wrong. It includes knowing what is right and fair and doing it. It includes taking the action needed when it’s needed. It’s based on respecting God. Wisdom is the opposite of foolishness. Wisdom from God is a spiritual blessing that God gives to his people. The book of \xt Proverbs\xt* described how wisdom was part of God creating the world. 1 Corinthians 1:30 describes Jesus as God’s wisdom.
\p \k Wise men\k*\im Important men from lands east of Jerusalem. They studied the stars in the sky. After Jesus was born, they worshipped him as the King of the world.
\p \k Wives\k*\im In Old Testament times and places many men had more than one wife. Many stories in the Bible show the problems that this caused for families. It caused problems in Jacob’s family. It also caused problems for leaders and kings like Solomon. Over time, the Israelites came to understand that a man should only have one wife. This was the practice for Jesus’ followers in the New Testament. (\k Marriage\k*)
\p \k Work\k*\im After God created the first human beings, he gave them work to do. The work of human beings is to be rulers of God’s world (\k rulers\k*). This work is a blessing for people. It includes farming the land. It includes the many ways that people take care of what God has given them. God wants people to follow his example of working and resting. God doesn’t want people to be lazy. People must do their best to provide for themselves, their families and their communities.
\p \k World\k*\im Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word world. The first meaning is the place God created for plants, animals and humans to live. The second meaning is a way of talking about evil. The world that God created is good and not evil. Yet the devil is evil and he has power to do evil things in the world. Many people choose to follow his evil ways. This is what New Testament writers meant when they wrote about the ways of the world. They also wrote that Jesus won the battle over the world. This means that Jesus has victory over sin, death and all evil spiritual beings. Jesus won this battle by suffering, dying on the cross and being raised from the dead. Because of this, Jesus’ followers live under the power of the Holy Spirit. They don’t live as slaves to the power of sin, death and evil. That is what New Testament writers meant about being set free from this evil world.
\p \k Worship only God\k*\im No one and nothing else but God should be worshipped. This is always true for all people everywhere. For hundreds of years, Abraham’s family line had worshipped God. Yet many of them had also worshipped false gods at the same time. The people groups all around them also worshipped many false gods. This was very common in the times and places of the Bible. But God is the only true God. In his covenant with the Israelites at Mount Sinai, God made this very clear. He commanded the Israelites to worship only him. That was the first and most important part of his covenant with them.
\p \k Xerxes\k*\im The ruler of the Persian kingdom from 486 to 465 BC. In the Hebrew language he was known as Ahasuerus.
\p \k Zebulun\k*\im The sixth son of Jacob and Leah. In the Hebrew language the name Zebulun probably means honour. His family line became a tribe of Israel.
\p \k Zechariah\k*\im A priest and prophet in Judah when the Persian government was in control. He was the son of Berekiah and was from the tribe of Levi. He encouraged Joshua and Zerubbabel to rebuild the temple. His visions and prophecies are recorded in the book of \xt Zechariah\xt*. This was a different Zechariah to the father of John the Baptist.
\p \k Zechariah - NT\k*\im The father of John the Baptist. Elizabeth was his wife. He was a priest from the tribe of Levi and from Aaron’s family line. Zechariah spoke a beautiful prophecy when John the Baptist was born.
\p \k Zelophehad’s daughters\k*\im Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah were from the tribe of Manasseh. Their father Zelophehad died in the desert after the Israelites refused to enter Canaan. His daughters received land for Zelophehad’s family line since he had no sons. They married cousins in their family group. This way their land would always belong to the tribe of Manasseh.
\p \k Zilpah\k*\im A servant of Leah. Leah gave her as a concubine to Jacob (\k concubines\k*). The family lines of her sons Gad and Asher became tribes of Israel.
