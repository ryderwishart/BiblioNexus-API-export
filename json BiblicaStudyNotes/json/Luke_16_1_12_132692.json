So he used his master’s money to help people who owed the master money. That way they would help him when he no longer had a job. The manager in the story wasn’t honest but he was clever. Jesus used him as an example for God’s people. Like that manager they should plan wisely. They should use their money to make their relationships with others strong. But unlike the manager, God’s people should use riches and property honestly."
