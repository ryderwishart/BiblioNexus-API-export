The crowds also sang an important song from Psalm 118. This song was hundreds of years old. It’s about how God comes to save his people who are suffering. Singing it about Jesus meant that Jesus was God’s answer to his people’s troubles."

Jesus made sure that it was once again used as a place of praise and healing."
